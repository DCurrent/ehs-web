<b>The Physical Configuration of the Job Site</b>
<p>
Tightly constrained areas may not permit the use of self-contained breathing apparatuses even though they might be an acceptable choice otherwise.  Likewise, working around obstructions or moving machinery that can snag hoses may limit the use of airline respirators.
<p>
<b>Worker Medical Condition</b>
<p>
Wearing respiratory protection poses a physical burden on the wearer.  When a worker's medical condition would prohibit restrictive breathing conditions, negative pressure respirators would not be an appropriate choice.
<p>
<b>Worker Comfort</b>
<p>
Worker preferences should be a consideration during the respirator selection process.  Among air purifying respirators, powered air purifying helmets have been subjectively rated the best for breathing ease, skin comfort, and in-mask temperature and humidity while filtering facepieces rate high for lightness and convenience.  Each, however, has its own drawbacks, and all these factors should be taken into account during selection.
