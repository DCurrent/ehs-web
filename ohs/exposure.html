It is essential for employers to characterize the nature and magnitude of employee exposures to respiratory hazards before selecting respiratory protection equipment.  Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of the final rule requires the employer to identify and evaluate the respiratory hazard(s) in the workplace.  Employers must make a "reasonable estimate" of the employee exposures anticipated to occur as a result of those hazards, including those likely to be encountered in reasonably foreseeable emergency situations, and must also identify the physical state and chemical for of such contaminant(s). 
<p>
<b>When must an employer conduct an exposure assessment?</b>  When employees are exposed to a respiratory hazard and/or are required to wear respirators.  Examples of when assessments should be considered may include but are not limited to:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>When OSHA has a substance specific standard (e.g., lead, methylene chloride).<br>
        <li>When employees notice symptoms (e.g., irritation, odor) or complain of respiratory health effects.<br>
        <li>When the workplace contains visible emissions (e.g., fumes, dust, aerosols).
        </ul>
<p>
<b>What is the identity and nature of the airborne contaminant?</b>  Specific characteristics of the airborne hazard must be established in order to select an appropriate respirator.
        <ul>
        <li>Is the airborne contaminant a particulate (dust, fumes, mist, aerosol) or a gas/vapor?<br>
<li>Is the airborne contaminant a chemical and are material safety data sheets available?<br>
<li>Is the airborne contaminant a biological agent (bacteria, mold, spores, fungi, virus)?<br>
<li>Are there any mandatory or recommended occupational exposure levels for the contaminant?
        </ul>
<p>
<b>How much employee exposure is there in the workplace?</b>  The final rule permits employers to use many approaches for estimating worker exposures to respiratory hazards.
        <ul>
        <li><b>Sampling</b> - Personal exposure monitoring is the "gold standard" for determining       employee exposures because this is the most reliable approach for assessing how much and        what type of respiratory protection is required in a given circumstance.
                <ul>
                <li>Sampling should utilize methods appropriate for contaminants.
                <li>Sampling should present the worst case exposures; or
                <li>Sampling should represent enough shifts and operations to determine the range               of exposure.
                </ul>
        <p>
        <li><b>Objective Information</b> - Employers may rely on information and data that      indicate that the use or handling of a product or material cannot, under worst-case     conditions, release concentrations of a respiratory hazard above a level that would     trigger the need for respirator use or require use of a more protective respirator.
                <ul>
                <li>Employers can use data on the physical and chemical properties of air               contaminants, combined with information on room dimensions, air exchange rates,                 contaminant release rates, and other pertinent data, including exposure patterns                and work practices, to estimate the maximum exposure that could be anticipated in               the workplace.
                <li>Data from industry-wide surveys by trade associations for use by their              members, as well as from stewardship programs operated by manufacturers for their               customers, are information on employee exposures in their workplaces.
                </ul>
        <p>
        <li><b>Variation</b> - Employers should account for potential variation in exposure by  using exposure data collected with a strategy that recognizes exposure variability, or by       using worst-case assumptions and estimation techniques to evaluate the highest  foreseeable levels to which employees may be exposed.  The use of safety factors may be         necessary to account for uneven dispersion of the contaminant in the air and the        proximity of the worker to the emission source.
        </ul>
