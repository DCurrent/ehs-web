<u>Selection</u>
<p>
When using a respirator for routine use, one needs only to remember to use good industrial hygiene practices.  The following basic information is required prior to selection of a respirator.
<ol>
<li>What is the contaminant?
<li>What is the toxicity of the contaminant?
<li>What are the biological effects of the contaminant?
<li>What is the threshold limit value?
<li>Is there a ceiling value for the contaminant?
<li>Is the contaminant a gas, liquid or solid, dust, mist or fume?
<li>What is the concentration of the contaminant in the workplace?
<li>Will the contaminant irritate the eyes at the workplace?
<li>Will the contaminant have adequate warning properties?
<li>Can the contaminant be absorbed through the skin?  If so, will it cause serious injury?
</ol>
<p>
A couple of further points need to be made when selecting a respirator:
<p>
<ol>
<li>When respirators requiring cartridges and canisters are used, the elements should be charged when the wearer detects odor.  This assumes that the contaminant has an odor or irritative effect.  A good rule of thumb to follow is that a contaminant is considered to have a warning property if the odor, irritation or taste threshold is not more than three times the exposure limit, there is no ceiling limit, and undetected exposure to this concentration range would not cause serious or irreversible health effects.  If not, the contaminant can be considered to have adequate warning properties.  Warning properties are considered to be adequate when odor, taste or irritation effects are detectable and persistent at concentrations at or below the TLV.  Odor obviously is not a good warning property, but it is all we have.
<p>
<li>When there is evidence that vapor breakthrough can occur in three minutes or less at airborne concentrations immediately dangerous to life or even below that level, a cartridge or canister air purifying device should not be allowed.
<p>
<li>Air purifying half-mask respirators should not be used if there is evidence of eye irritation.
<p>
<li>Cartridge and canisters must never be used in atmospheres immediately dangerous to life.
</ol>
<p>
<u>Respirator Use</u>
<p>
Practicalities of Respirator Issue
<ul>
Issuance of respirators seems simple, but issue of the incorrect respirator may injure or even kill a worker, so the matter cannot be treated lightly.  The person responsible for issuing respirators must be adequately trained to make sure that the correct respirator is issued for each job. 
<p>
When practical, a respirator should be assigned to individual workers for their exclusive use, and should be permanently marked to indicate to whom they are assigned.  Care must be taken to ensure that the marking does not hurt the respirator performance.  If possible, records should be kept on the issuance and use of each respirator.  To do so, each must be permanently identified.
<p>
Records should include the date of initial issue, the dates of reissue, and listing of repairs.
</ul>
<p>
Supervision of Respirator Use
<ul>
Respirators in use should be randomly inspected frequently to ensure that those selected for the job are being used and that they are in good condition.  Respiratory protection is no better than the respirator in use.  Periodic monitoring of respirator use should include:<p>
* Determine that proper respirators are being used.<br>
* Determine that respirators are being worn properly.<br>
* Consult with wearers about:
	<ul>
	<li>Discomfort
	<li>Resistance to breathing
	<li>Fatigue
	<li>Interference with vision
	<li>Interference with communications
	<li>Restriction of movement
	<li>Interference with job performance
	<li>Confidence in the respirator
	</ul>
<p>
Problems discovered during the random inspections must be rectified.
</ul>
<p>
Employees responsibility
<ul>
Proper supervision of respirator use should ensure that individual workers understand that they have the following responsibilities:<p>
<ul>
<li>They shall use the respirator as instructed.<br>
<li>They shall guard against damaging the respirator.<br>
<li>They shall go immediately to an area having respirable air if the respirator fails to provide proper protection.<br>
<li>They shall report any respirator malfunction to a person responsible for the respirator program.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Fit testing before use:
<ul>
Respirator facepieces shall be checked for fit each time they are worn.  The wearer can make either the positive- or the negative-pressure test, discussed earlier, before entering a hazardous atmosphere, but a qualitative check using either isoamyl acetate or irritant smoke is preferred.
</ul>
<p>
Functional and Physical Characteristics and Use Limitations of Respirators
<ul>
Limitations of particulate-filter elements:
<p>
The airflow resistance for a particulate-removing respirator filter element increases as the quantity of particles it retains increases.  Filter element plugging means that the element must be replaced frequently.  Filter elements designed to be cleaned and reused also should be cleaned at least daily.
<p>
Performance of some fibrous filter materials (electrostatic felts) is hurt by storage in very humid atmospheres, so care should be taken in storing filter elements.  Performance also may deteriorate during use of water vapor in the workplace atmosphere.  Airborne liquid particles (aqueous and non-aqueous) and extremely small solid particles may deteriorate materials.  Solid particles plug fibrous filter materials (including electrostatic felts), and, although this plugging increases the resistance to air flow, significant plugging increases the materials/ efficiency in removing particles from the air.
</ul>
<p>
Advantages and Limitations of Non-powered Air-purifying Respirators
<ul>
In addition to those limitations imposed by respiratory-inlet coverings, particulate-filter elements, and sorbent cartridges and canisters, further limitations of non-powered air-purifying respirators should be considered.
<p>
An important disadvantage is the negative pressure created inside the respiratory-inlet covering during inhalation that can cause air contaminants to penetrate the covering if it fits poorly.  Care should be taken to provide each wearer with a respirator that fits.  This can best be accomplished by individual fittings.</ul>
