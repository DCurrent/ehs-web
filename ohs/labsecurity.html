              are recognized as places that use a wide assortment of highly hazardous 
              materials. When working with these materials every day, it is easy 
              to forget about the harm these materials can cause if they are stolen. 
              Also, it easy to overlook the risk of highly hazardous materials 
              that are used very infrequently. Following the terrorist attacks 
              of September 2001 and the &quot;anthrax letters&quot; sent the same 
              month, much attention has been directed to practical measures that 
              will keep hazardous materials out of the hands of terrorists and 
              criminals.</font> <br />
              <br />
              <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Principal 
              investigators need to take specific actions to prevent unauthorized 
              entry to labs, secure highly hazardous materials against theft, 
              and ensure compliance with new security regulations. Environmental 
              Health &amp; Safety urges principal investigators to implement procedures 
              necessary to provide security of all hazardous materials in their 
              areas of responsibility. One objective is to minimize the risk of 
              theft, especially during that five-minute window when the lab is 
              left unattended. One easy way to increase security is to make sure 
              that your laboratory door is locked whenever the lab is left unattended, 
              even for a few minutes</font>.<br />
              <br />
              <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many 
              laboratories already implement various security measures, including 
              locking up controlled substances and syringes and needles. Principal 
              investigators should review and assess the security of their highly 
              hazardous materials, such as infectious agents, toxins, radioactive 
              materials, acutely toxic chemicals, carcinogens, teratogens, explosive 
              or reactive chemicals, and compressed gases. The following guidelines 
              were adapted from Appendix F of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety 
              in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories. The guidelines are 
              intended to reduce the risk for unauthorized removal of hazardous 
              materials from your laboratory:</font><br />
