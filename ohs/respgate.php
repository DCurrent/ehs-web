                    <h1>Respiratory Protection</h1>
                    <h2>Written Program</h2>
<p>For any employment or tasks that  REQUIRE respiratory protection, either due to known/possible exposures,  regulations, or internal policy, the department in which the affected employee  works must have a written Respiratory Protection Program. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://ehs.uky.edu/docs/pdf/ohs_resp_program_template_0001.pdf">template</a> is available. The specific  written program must reflect the conditions and realities of operations within  the department that requires the respirator use. This program must be reviewed  and (if necessary) updated on an annual basis. Employees must also be trained  or instructed on the contents of the department-specific Respiratory Protection  Program at least annually.</p>
<h2>Voluntary Use of Disposable Filtering Facepiece (e.g. N-95) Respirators</h2>
<p>If a department does not require  the use of respirators due to the absence of known or probable respiratory  hazards, but an employee wishes to wear a disposable dust-mist-fume respirator  such as an N-95 filtering facepiece, this can be permitted at the discretion of  the supervisor. The employee must read and sign a copy of <a href="../docs/pdf/ohs_resp_appendix_d.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix D to the OSHA Respiratory Protection  Standard</a>. </p>
<p>Voluntary use of  filtering facepiece respirators does not require completion of a written  Respiratory Protection Program, medical evaluation, or fit testing. However, if  the use of filtering facepieces is mandatory, or if the voluntary use is for tight-fitting  half-face or full-face respirators, then the full requirements of a written  program, medical evaluation, fit testing, and training apply. </p>
<h2>Fit Testing</h2>
<p>It  is essential that respiratory protective equipment be properly fitted to the  employee when it is issued. All the care that went into the design and  manufacture of a respirator to maximize protection will not protect the wearer  if there is an improper match between facepiece and wearer or if the wearer  follows improper wearing practices. <br>
There  are two considerations with respect to proper fit:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Assuming that there are several       brands of a particular type of facepiece available (you should provide       several to choose from), which one fits best?</li>
  <li>How does the user know when the       respirator fits properly?</li>
</ol>
<p>The  answers to the above questions can be determined by the use of a fit test. Quantitative  fit tests are conducted by UK Health &amp; Safety after an employee&rsquo;s initial  program enrollment (see below) and annually thereafter. </p>
Even N-95 filtering  facepiece respirators require annual fit testing, unless their usage is  strictly voluntary. Loose-fitting hood-type Powered Air-Purifying Respirators  (PAPR) do not require fit testing, as they do not form a tight seal around the  face/head/neck. PAPRs with tight-fitting elastomeric facepieces require annual  fit testing.
<h2><strong><a name="enrollment"></a>Initial Program Enrollment and Medical Evaluation</strong></h2>
<p>For  employees required to use respiratory protection, and who have never been  medically qualified and/or been fit-tested for a respirator:</p>
<p>UK Health  and Safety provides fit-testing, training and program development assistance  for the use of respiratory protection. Employees who are required to use  respiratory protection must be medically qualified prior to being fit-tested  for a respirator. Once medically qualified, a fit-test and respiratory  protection training will be conducted.<br>
  The  following procedures outline the steps to be taken to obtain medical  qualification, fit-testing, and training.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>The employee's supervisor must       complete the top section of the&nbsp;<a href="http://ehs.uky.edu/docs/pdf/ohs_resp_request.pdf" target="_blank">Respirator Program Request</a>.</li>
  <li>The employee completes       the&nbsp;<a href="http://ehs.uky.edu/docs/pdf/ohs_resp_medical_ah.pdf" target="_blank">Respirator Medical       Questionnaire</a>.</li>
  <li>The&nbsp;<a href="http://ehs.uky.edu/docs/pdf/ohs_resp_request.pdf" target="_blank">Respirator Program Request</a>&nbsp;and       the&nbsp;<a href="http://ehs.uky.edu/docs/pdf/ohs_resp_medical_ah.pdf" target="_blank">Respirator Medical       Questionnaire</a>&nbsp;are faxed to UK Healthcare/Employee       Health for review by a healthcare professional.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Secure Fax: 859-257-9814&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Employee Health Contact: Leslie Ehrmantraut (859-218-3257)&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The Respirator Medical Evaluation Questionnaire will be reviewed, and the       healthcare professional will either clear the employee to wear a       respirator based on the information provided in the questionnaire, or the       employee will be contacted to schedule a medical exam. Final clearance to       wear a respirator will be indicated by the healthcare professional's       signature on the Respirator Request Form. The form should be maintained in       the employee&rsquo;s personnel record, and the Respirator Medical Evaluation       Questionnaire should be maintained at UK Healthcare/Employee Health with       the employee's medical records.</li>
  <li>The respirator request form       shall be completed and signed by the healthcare professional before fit       testing can be conducted. Please allow 5-7 working days from the submittal       date to UK Healthcare/Employee Health before contacting UK Health &amp;       Safety at 257-3827 to schedule fit testing.</li>
</ol>
Fit-testing and training is  required to be repeated on annual basis. Initial Respirator Use training is  available&nbsp;<a href="http://ehs.uky.edu/classes/classes_ohs_0001.php#respirator_use">online</a> and must be repeated at least annually, provided that the employee  continues to require respiratory protection for their employment. Training on  the department&rsquo;s specific written Respiratory Protection Program must also be  performed at least annually.
<h2><strong>Renewal of Enrollment and Medical Evaluation</strong></h2>
<p>For employees who have been enrolled in a departmental Respiratory  Protection Program for 12 months or longer:</p>
<p>UK Health  and Safety provides annual fit-testing, training and program modification  assistance for the continuing use of respiratory protection. Employees who are  currently enrolled in a departmental Respiratory Protection Program must have  their medical qualification renewed prior to being refit-tested for a  respirator. Once medically requalified, the annual fit-test and respiratory  protection training will be conducted.<br>
The  following procedures outline the steps to be taken to obtain medical re  qualification, and annual fit-testing, and training.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>The employee's supervisor must       complete the top section of the&nbsp;<u><a href="http://ehs.uky.edu/docs/pdf/ohs_resp_request.pdf" target="_blank">Respirator Program Request</a></u>.</li>
