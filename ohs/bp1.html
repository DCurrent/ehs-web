<font size="4" face="Arial">EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN FOR BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS</FONT>

<P><hr></center><P>
<a name="intro"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Introduction</b></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial">
Every health service facility shall evaluate its routine and reasonably anticipated tasks and procedures to determine where there is actual or potential exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.  All employees whose duties include routine or reasonably anticipated tasks or procedures where there is an actual or potential exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material shall be included under this plan.  A list of all job classifications in which all employees in those classifications have occupational exposure will be maintained as well as a list of job classifications in which some employees have exposure.  A list of all tasks and procedures in which occupational exposure occurs in the latter group will be maintained.  If the nature of the task or activity has direct contact with blood or other body fluids to which universal precautions will apply, personal protective equipment shall be available and worn as outlined in this policy, but use of such equipment should not be used in exposure determination.  If activity is performed without blood exposure, but exposure may occur in an emergency, the protective equipment must be available.  After these potential exposures have been determined, rationale of this determination will be documented and kept as a record.  This exposure determination shall be reviewed annually or with any significant changes in tasks or procedures and updated as necessary.<P>

<font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Universal Precautions Procedures</b></font>
<a name="universal"></a>
<P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
Since medical history and examination cannot reliably identify all patients infected with HIV or other bloodborne pathogens, blood and body fluid precautions shall be consistently used for all patients, especially including those in emergency care settings in which the risk of blood exposure is increased and the infectious status of the patient is usually unknown.<P>
<OL>
<LI>All health care workers will routinely use appropriate barrier precautions to preventive skin and mucous membrane exposure when contact with blood or other body fluids of any patient is anticipated.  Gloves shall be worn for touching blood and body fluids, mucous membranes, or non-intact skin of all patients, for handling items or surfaces soiled with blood or body fluids, and for performing venipuncture and other vascular access procedures.  Gloves shall be changed after contact with each patient.  Masks and protective eye wear of face shields shall be worn during procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other body fluids to prevent exposure of mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes.  Gowns or aprons will be worn during procedures that are likely to generate splashes of blood or other body fluids.<P>

<LI>Hands and other skin surfaces will be washed thoroughly with soap and water or mucous membranes flushed with water immediately or as soon as feasible if contaminated with blood or other body fluids following contact.  Hands shall be washed immediately after gloves or other personal protective equipment are removed, and upon leaving the work area.<P>

<LI>All health care workers should take precautions to prevent injuries caused by needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices during procedures; when cleaning used instruments; during disposal of used needles; and when handling sharp instruments after procedures.  To prevent needlestick injuries, needles shall <B>not</B> be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand.  Recapping or removing of contaminated needles or sharps should only be done if no other alternative is feasible and required by a specific medical procedure and if performed must be done through the use of a mechanical device or a one-handed technique.  After they are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items shall be placed in puncture resistant containers for disposal; the puncture resistant containers should be located as close as practical to the use area.  Large bore reusable needles will be placed in a puncture resistant container and transport to the reprocessing area.<P>

<LI>Although saliva has not been implicate in HIV transmission, to minimize the need for emergency mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices shall be available for use in areas in which the need for resuscitation is predictable.<P>

<LI>Health care workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis should refrain from all direct patient care and from handling patient care equipment until the condition resolves.<P>

<LI>Pregnant health care workers are not known to be at greater risk of contracting HIV infection than health care workers who are not pregnant; however, if a health care worker develops HIV infection during pregnancy, the infant is at risk of infection resulting from perinatal transmission.  Because of this risk, pregnant health care workers should be especially familiar with and strictly adhere to precautions to minimize the risk of HIV transmission.<P>
</OL>

Universal precautions are intended to supplement rather than replace recommendations from routine infection control, such as hand washing and use of gloves to prevent gross microbial contamination of hands.  Hand washing facilities  should be readily available.  If facilities are not and cannot be made available, an appropriate antiseptic hand cleaner in conjunction with clean towels or antiseptic towelettes must be available and the hands washed with soap and running water as soon as feasible.<P>

Universal precautions apply to blood and other body fluids containing visible blood.  Blood is the single most important source of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and other blood pathogens in the occupational setting.  Universal precautions also apply to tissues, semen, vaginal secretions, and the following fluids:  cerebral spinal, synodal, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, and amniotic.<P>

Universal precautions are the minimum precautions for all procedures in an emergency or outpatient setting in which there is surgical entry into tissues or report of major traumatic injuries.  Routing use of appropriate barrier precautions such as gloves and surgical masks must be worn for all invasive procedures.  Protective eye wear with face shield must be worn if splashing of blood or body fluids is likely.  Also protective barrier gowns or aprons must be worn if spills are expected.<P>

The methods used during employee exposure should be carefully reviewed and attempts at minimizing exposure by engineering and work practice controls should be used as the primary method to minimize or eliminate the exposure.  These controls should be examined and maintained or replaced at the time of the annual exposure determination or as needed.<P>

<B>All personal protective equipment shall be removed immediately upon leaving the work are and placed in an appropriately designated area or container for storage, washing, decontamination or disposal.</B><P>

Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm and handling contact lenses are <B>prohibited</B> in laboratories and other work areas where blood or other potentially infectious materials are likely to be present.  Food and drink shall <B>not</B> be stored in refrigerators, freezers, or cabinets where blood or other potentially infectious materials are present or other areas of possible contamination such as counter tips.  All procedures involving blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be performed in such a manner as to minimize splashing, spraying or aerolization of these substances.  Mouth pipetting suctioning is  <B>prohibited</B>.<P>  

<font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Personal Protective Equipment</b></font>
<a name="protective"></a>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
Appropriate protective barriers will be available and used to prevent exposure to blood, body fluids containing visible blood and other fluids to which universal precautions apply.  From the exposure determinations, the appropriate protective work clothing and equipment  such as, but not limited to gloves; gowns; laboratory coats; face shields or masks and eye protections, and mouthpieces; resuscitation bags; pocket masks or other related devices shall be kept available in appropriate size and at no cost to the employee and easily accessible to the employee.  If an employee temporarily and briefly declines to use personal protective equipment under rare and extraordinary circumstances, it must be the employee's professional judgment that in this specific instance its use would have prevented the delivery of health care or public safety services or would have increased the hazard to the safety of the worker or a co-worker.  When this is done, the circumstances will be investigated and documented to determine whether changes can be instituted to prevent such occurrences in the future.  These materials must be repaired or replaced as needed to maintain their effectiveness and cleaned, laundered or disposed of at no cost to the employee.<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Gloves</B><P>
<DD>Gloves should be worn when the employee has a potential for direct skin contact with blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, non-intact skin of patient, when handling items or surfaces with blood or other potentially infectious materials, and when performing vascular access procedures with one exception.  <B>Gloves must be worn by a skilled phlebotomist when drawing blood samples</B>.  Sterile gloves shall be used for procedures involving contact with mucous membrane, unless otherwise indicated, and for other patient care or diagnostic procedures that do not require the use of sterile gloves.  Gloves must be changed between patient contact.  For those allergic to the normally provided gloves, hypoallergenic gloves, glove liners, powderless gloves and other similar alternatives will be provided.<P>

Surgical or examination gloves can not be washed or disinfected for reuse.  They also must not be used when visibly soiled, torn, punctured, or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised.  Utility gloves (e.g., rubber household gloves) for housekeeping chores involving potential blood contact and for instrument cleaning and decontamination procedures can be used.  Utility gloves may be decontaminated and reused, but must be discarded if they are peeling, cracked, or discolored, or if they have punctures, tears, or other evidence of deterioration or other ability to function as a barrier is compromised.<P>

<DT><B>Respirators and Eye Protection</B><P>
<DD>Respirators and eye protection or chin-length face shields shall be worn whenever splashes, spray, splatters, droplets or aerosols of blood or other potentially infectious material may be generated and there is potential for eye, nose, and mouth contamination.<P>

<DT><B>Clothing</B><P>
<DD>Appropriate protective clothing shall be worn when the employee has potential for blood and other potentially infectious materials.  Type and characteristics will depend upon the materials and the task and degree of exposure anticipated; however, the clothing selected shall form an effective barrier so as not to permit potentially infectious materials to pass through or reach the employees' work clothes, street clothes, undergarments, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use and for the duration of time the protective equipment will be used.  Gowns, lab coats, aprons, or similar clothing shall be worn if there is a potential for soiling of clothes with blood or other potentially infectious materials.  Fluid resistant clothing shall be worn if there is a potential for splashing or spraying of blood or other potential infectious material.  Surgical caps or hoods shall be worn if there is a potential for splashing or splattering of blood or potentially infectious materials on the head.  Fluid proof clothing shall be worn if there is a potential of clothing becoming soiled with blood or other potentially infectious material.  Fluid proof shoe covers will be worn if there is a potential for shoes to become contaminated or soaked with blood or other infectious materials.  If any garment is penetrated by potentially infectious material, the garment shall be removed immediately or as soon as feasible.<P>
</DL>

<a name="worksite"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Worksite Hygiene</b></font><P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
The worksite will be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition.  An appropriate written schedule will be kept for cleaning with the method of documentation determined by location within the facility, type of surface to be cleaned, type of soil present, and the tasks and procedures being performed.<P>

<a name="decontamination"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Equipment and Environmental Decontamination</b></font><P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
All equipment and environmental working surfaces shall be properly cleaned and disinfected after contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials.  Standard sterilization and disinfected procedures for patient care equipment currently recommended for use (Centers for Disease Control, 1985, HHS Publication NO. 99-1117) in a variety of health care settings are adequate to sterilize of disinfect instruments, devices, or other items contaminated with blood or other body fluids from persons infected with bloodborne pathogens, including HIB.  Instruments and devices that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system of any patient or through which blood flows shall be sterilized before reuse.  Devices or items that contact intact mucous membranes shall be sterilized or receive high level disinfection.  Chemical germicides that are registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency as "sterile" may be used either for sterilization of high level disinfection, depending upon contact time.  Medical devices or instruments that require sterilization of disinfection shall be thoroughly cleaned before being exposed to the germicides, solution of  10 percent sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) prepared daily is an inexpensive and effective germicide.  Environmental surfaces such as walls, floors and other surfaces are not associate with transmission of infections to patients or health care workers.  Therefore, extraordinary attempts to disinfect and sterilize these environmental surfaces are not necessary; however, cleaning and removal of soil shall be done routinely.<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Disinfectants</B><P>
<DD>Chemical germicides that are approved for use as "hospital disinfectants" and are tuberculoid when used at recommended dilutions can be used to decontaminate spills of blood an other body fluids.  Visible material should first be removed before they are decontaminated.  Gloves shall be worn during cleaning and decontaminating procedures.<P>

<DT><B>Work Surfaces</B><P>
<DD>Work surfaces shall be decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant and after completion of a procedure; immediately or as soon as feasible when surfaces are overtly contaminated or after any spill of blood or potentially infectious material; and at the end of the work shift if the surface may have become contaminated since the last cleaning.<P>

<DT><B>Protective Coverings</B><P>
<DD>Protective covering such as plastic wrap, aluminum foil, or imperiously baked absorbent paper may be used to cover equipment and environmental surfaces.  These covering shall be removed and replaced as soon as feasible at the end of the work shift if they have become contaminated during that shift or when they become overtly contaminated.<P>

<DT><B>Equipment</B><P>
<DD>Equipment that may become contaminated with blood and other potentially infectious materials shall be checked routinely and decontaminated as necessary and decontaminated both inside and outside prior to servicing or shipping.  If decontamination is not feasible, a readily observable label shall be attached stating which portions remain contaminated and this information will be conveyed to all affected employees, the servicing representative, and other who need to know, prior to handling or shipping.<P>

<DT><B>Receptacles</B><P>
<DD>All bind, pails, cans, and similar receptacles intended for reuse which have a potential for becoming contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be inspected, cleaned and decontaminated on a regularly scheduled basis and cleaned and decontaminated immediately or as soon as possible upon visible contamination.<P>

Broken glassware which may be contaminated shall <B>not</B> be picked up directly with the hands.  It shall be cleaned up using mechanical means, such as a brush and a dust pan, vacuum cleaner, thong, cotton swabs, or forceps.<P>

Reusable items contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious material shall be decontaminated prior to washing and/or reprocessing.<P>
</DL>

<a name="containers"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Adequate Containers</b></font><P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
Specimens of blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be placed in a closable leakproof container and labeled or color coded according to this document prior to being stored or transported.  If outside contamination of the primary container is likely, then a second leakproof container that is labeled or color coded according to this document shall be placed over the outside of the first one and closed to prevent leakage during handling, storage, or transport.  If a puncture in the primary container is likely, it shall be placed in a leakproof, puncture resistant secondary container.<P>

<a name="infectious"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Infectious Waste</b></font><P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
The selection of procedures for disposal of infectious waste is determined by the relative risk of disease transmission and application of local regulations, shall be consulted prior to disposal procedures and followed.  Wastes for which special precautions were prudent would include those of blood specimens or blood products.  Infective waste, in general, shall be either incinerated or shall be decontaminated before disposal in a sanitary landfill.  Bulk blood, suction fluids, excretions, and secretions may be carefully poured down a drain connected to a sanitary sewer where permitted.  Sanitary sewers may also be used to dispose of other infectious waste capable of being ground and flushed into the sewer, where permitted.  All infectious waste destined for disposal shall be paced in a closable, leakproof container or bag that is color coded and labeled as outlined in this document.  It will be closed prior to removal to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handling, storage, transport, or shipping.  If outside contamination of a container or bag occurs or is likely to occur, then a second leakproof container or bag which is closeable and labeled or color coded shall be placed over the outside of the first and closed to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handling, storage, shipping or transport.  Immediately after use, sharps shall be disposed of in a closable, leakproof on sides and bottom, puncture resistant, disposable container that is labeled and color coded according to this document.  These containers shall be maintained upright through use, easily accessible to personnel and located as close as feasible in the immediate area of use or can reasonably be anticipated to be found and shall be replaced routinely and not allowed to overfill.  Contaminated reusable sharps shall be stored or processed so employees do not reach by hand into the container.  When moving containers of contaminated sharps from the area of use, the containers will be closed immediately prior to removal prevent spillage of protrusion of contents during handling, storage, transport or shipping.  If leakage is possible, it will be places in a secondary container, which is closable, contains all contents, leakproof, labeled and color coded according to this document.  Removable containers shall not be opened, emptied or cleaned manually or in any other manner which would expose employees to the risk of percutaneous injury.<P>

<a name="linens"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Soiled Linens</b></font><P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
Although soiled linen may be contaminated with pathogenic microorganism, the risk of actual disease transmission is negligible.  Rather than rigid procedures and specification, hygienic storage and processing of clean and soiled linen are recommended.  Soiled linen should be handled as little as possible, with minimum agitation to prevent gross microbial contamination of the air and personnel handling the linen.  Also, soiled linen should be bagged at a location where it is used and shall not be sorted or rinsed in the location of use.  Contaminated  laundry shall be placed and transported in bags that are labeled or color coded as described in this document.  Whenever this laundry is wet and presents potential of soak through or leakage from bag, it shall be placed and transported in a soak and leakproof  bags.  Laundry workers will wear protective gloves and other personal protective clothing when handling or sorting potentially contaminated laundry.  The contaminated laundry shall be cleaned and laundered in such a way that any infectious agents present are inactivated or destroyed.  Normal laundry cycle shall be used according to the washer and detergent manufacturer's recommendations.  If the contaminated laundry is shipped off site to a second facility not utilizing universal precautions in the handling of all laundry, it must be placed in bags labeled and color coded in accordance with this document.<P>

<a name="surveillance"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Medical Surveillance</b></font><P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
A medical surveillance program should be in place for all employees covered by this document.  All the medical evaluation procedures to be performed will be under the supervision of a licensed physician and all laboratory tests conducted by an accredited laboratory.  All evaluations, procedures, vaccinations, vaccination series, and post-exposure evaluation and follow up, including prophylaxis, are provided without cost to the employee, at a reasonable time and place, and according to current standard recommendations for medical practice by the USPHS at the time these evaluations and procedures take place.<P>

The initial evaluation will be given prior to the job assignment and shall include an occupational/medical history, including any medical problem which could interfere with an employee's ability to use protective clothing and equipment or receive vaccination and the status of the HBV vaccination.  The physical examination is limited to those systems and areas, which in the opinion of the examining physician need to be evaluated to determine whether any medical problems exist to meet the above criteria.  When employees have received the training outlined in this document and within 10 working days of initial assignment, HBV vaccination shall be offered to all employees occupationally exposed as a part of their job duties to blood or other material potentially infectious for HBV, unless the employee has had a previous HBV vaccination or unless antibody testing has revealed that the employee is immune or the vaccine is contraindicated for medical reasons.  If the employee initially declines HBV vaccination, but at a later date, while still covered under this document, decides to accept the HBV vaccine, it shall be provided at that time.  Should a booster dose(s) be recommended at a future date, such booster dose(s) shall also be provided. If an employee declines to accept vaccination when offered, he will sign the a declination statement.<P>

HBV antibody testing shall be made available to an employee who desires such testing prior to deciding whether or not to receive HBV vaccination. If the employee is found to be immune to HBV by virtue of adequate antibody titer, the vaccine will not be offered to that employee.   HIV vaccination, when and if safe and effective HIV vaccine becomes available, will be offered to all employees occupationally exposed to blood or other materials potentially infectious for HIV.<P>

Any employee covered by this document who has a parenteral or mucous membrane exposure to blood or other body fluids or who has a cutaneous exposure involving large amounts of blood or prolonged contact with blood, especially when the exposed skin is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis will have a confidential medical evaluation and follow-up provided.<P>

As part of a confidential medical record, the circumstances of exposure will be recorded. Relevant information includes route(s) of exposure, the activity in which the work was engaged at the time of exposure, the extent to which the appropriate work practices and protective equipment were used and a description of the source exposure shall he recorded. All reporting responsibilities under federal and state laws will be performed.<P>

<a name="exposure"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Employee Exposure</b></font><P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
Once an exposure has occurred, a blood sample will be drawn after consent is obtained from the source individual unless identification is infeasible. It will be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody to human immunodeficiency virus as soon as feasible. Local laws regarding consent for testing source individuals shall be followed. If consent is not obtained, establish that legally required consent cannot be obtained. When the source individual's consent is not required by law, their blood, if available, shall be tested and the results documented. Pre-test counseling, post-test counseling and referral for evaluation and treatment will be provided. Results of the source individual's testing shall be made available to the exposed employee, and the employee shall be informed of applicable laws and regulations concerning disclosure of the identity and infectious status of the source individual. <P>

An exposed employee's blood shall be collected as soon as feasible and tested after consent is obtained. If baseline blood is drawn, but employee does not consent for HIV serologic testing, the sample shall be preserved for at least 90 days. If within 90 days of the exposure incident, the employee elects to have the sample tested, such testing will be done as soon as feasible.  For an exposure to a source individual found to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, the worker who has not previously been given hepatitis B vaccine should receive the vaccine series. A single dose of hepatitis B immune globulin will he given if within seven days of exposure. If the employee has previously received vaccine, they will be tested for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen and be given one dose of vaccine and one dose of immune globulin if the antibody level in the blood sample is inadequate. If the source individual is negative for surface antigen and the worker has not been vaccinated, this opportunity will he offered to provide hepatitis B vaccination. If the source individual refuses testing or they cannot be identified, the unvaccinated worker shall receive the hepatitis B vaccine series. Immune globulin administration should be considered on an individual basis if the source individual is known or suspected to be at a high risk for HBV infection. Management and treatment, if any, of workers who receive an exposure from a source who refuses testing or who is not identifiable, will be individualized. Current recommendations by the USPHS will be followed in post-exposure prophylaxis. <P>

For any exposure to a source individual who has AIDS, who is found to be positive for HIV infection or who refuses testing, the worker should be counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluated clinically and serologically for evidence of HIV infection as soon as possible after the exposure. In view of the evolving nature of HIV post exposure management, the worker shall be informed of current USPHS Guidelines. The worker will be advised to report to seek medical evaluation for any acute febrile illness that occurs within 12 weeks after the exposure. Such an illness, particularly one characterized by fever, rash or Iymphadenopathy may be indicative of recent HIV infection. Following the initial test at time of exposure, seronegative workers should be retested 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after exposure to determine whether transmission has occurred. During this follow-up period exposed worker should follow the USPHS recommendations for preventing transmission of HIV. If source individual was tested and found to be seronegative. baseline testing of exposed worker with follow-up testing 12 weeks later may be performed if desired by the worker or recommended by the physician. If source individual cannot be identified, decisions regarding appropriate follow up should be individualized. Serological testing should be made available to all workers who may be concerned they had been infected with HIV through an occupational exposure.<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Evaluating Physician</B><P>
<DD>The evaluating physician of the exposed employee should have a copy of OSHA Standard on Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR Part 1910.1030), a description of the employee's duties as they relate to the exposure, a description of any personal protective equipment that was used or to be used, documentation of the route(s) of exposure and the circumstances under which the exposure occurred, the results of blood tests when available, and all medical records relevant to the appropriate treatment of the employee, including vaccination status. The evaluating physician shall have his opinion in the employee's confidential health record and a copy will be provided to the employee all within 15 days after the evaluation. This written opinion shall be limited to the following information: <P>
<OL>
<LI>The physician's recommended limitation on employee's use of personal protective clothing or equipment and ability to receive vaccination and if employee has received such vaccination.<P>

<LI>A statement that the employee has been informed of the results of his  evaluation and has been told of any medical conditions resulting from exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials which require further evaluation or treatment. <P>

<LI> The written opinion will not reveal specific findings or diagnoses which are unrelated to the employee's ability to wear protective clothing or equipment or receive vaccination.  Such findings and diagnoses shall remain confidential.<P> 
</OL>
Health care workers with impaired immune systems resulting from HIV infection or other causes are at increased risk of acquiring or experiencing serious complications of infectious disease.  Of particular concern is the risk of severe infection following exposure to patients with infectious diseases that are easily transmitted if appropriate precautions are not taken.  Any worker with an impaired immune system should be counseled about the potential risk associated with taking care of patients with any transmissible infection and should continue to follow recommendations for infection control to minimize risk to other infectious agents.  The question whether workers infected with HIV, especially those who perform invasive procedures, can adequately and safely be allowed to perform patient care duties or whether their work assignments should be changed, must be determined on an individual basis with the decision being made in conjunction with the employee's personal physician(s) and the company physicians.<P>

<a name="labels"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Warning Labels</b></font><P>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
Warning labels shall be affixed to containers of the infectious waste, refrigerators and freezers containing blood or other potentially infectious material or other containers used to store or transport blood or other potentially infectious materials. The labels shall be fluorescent orange or orange-red or predominately so, with lettering and symbols in contrasting colors, using the accepted biohazard label. The label shall either be an integral part of the container or shall be affixed as closely as safely possible to the container by string, wire, adhesive, or other method that prevents their loss or unintentional removal.

Policy for minimizing risk of transmission of AIDS during CPR training -the following general recommendations will be followed:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The manufacturer's recommendations and provisions for sanitary practices for the training mannequin should be followed.<P>

<LI>Students or instructors should not actively participate in training sessions (hands-on training with mannequins) if they have dermatologic lesions on hands or in oral or circumoral areas, if they are known to be seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigens, if they have upper respiratory tract infections, if they have AIDS, or if the student or instructor has reason to believe that he or she has been exposed to or is in the active stage of any infectious process. <P>

<LI>Students should be told in advance that the training sessions will involve close physical contact with their fellow students. <P>

<LI> If more than one CPR mannequin is used in a particular training class, students should preferably be assigned in pairs, with each pair having contact with only one mannequin. This approach would lessen the possible contamination of several mannequins by one individual and therefore limit possible exposure of other class members. <P>

<LI>All persons responsible for CPR training should be thoroughly familiar with hygienic concepts (e.g., thorough hand washing prior to mannequin contact and not eating during class to avoid contaminating mannequins with food particles) as well as the procedures for cleaning and maintaining mannequins and accessories (e.g., face shields). Mannequins should he inspected routinely for signs of physical deterioration, such as cracks or tears in plastic surfaces, which makes thorough cleaning difficult, if not impossible. The clothes and hair of mannequins should be washed periodically (e.g., monthly or whenever visibly soiled).<P>

<LI> During the training of two-rescuer CPR, there is no opportunity to disinfect the mannequin between students when the so-called switching procedure is practiced. To limit the potential for disease transmission during this exercise, the student taking over ventilation on the mannequin should simulate ventilation instead of blowing into the mannequin. This recommendation is consistent with current training recommendations of the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association. <P>

<LI>Training for the obstructed airway procedure involves the student using his or her finger to sweep foreign matter out of the mannequin's mouth.  This action could contaminate the student's finger with exhaled moisture and saliva from previous students in the same class or contaminate the mannequin with material from the student's finger. When practicing this procedure, the finger sweep should be either simulated or done on a mannequin whose airway was decontaminated before the procedure and
 	will be decontaminated after the procedure. <P>

<LI>Personnel conducting the mannequin disassembly and decontamination should wear protective latex gloves and wash their hands after finishing. At the end of each class, the following procedures should be done as soon as possible to avoid drying of contamination on mannequin surfaces:<P>
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Disassemble the mannequin as directed by manufacturer.
<LI>As indicated, thoroughly wash all external and internal surfaces (also reusable protective face shields) with warm soapy water and brushes.
<LI>Rinse all surfaces with fresh water.
<LI>Wet all surfaces with a sodium hypochlorite solution having at least 500 ppm of free available chlorine (one-quarter cup of liquid household bleach per gallon of tap water) for 10 minutes (this solution must be made fresh at each class and discarded after each use)
<LI>Rinse with fresh water and immediately dry all external and internal surfaces; rinsing with alcohol will aid drying of internal surfaces, and this drying will prevent the survival and growth of bacterial or fungal pathogens if the mannequins are stored for periods longer than the day of cleaning. <P>
</OL>

<LI> Each time a different student uses the mannequin in a training class, the individual protective face shield, if used, should be changed. Between students or after the instructor demonstrates a procedure such as cleaning any obstruction from the airway, the face and inside of the mouth of the mannequin should be wiped vigorously with clean, absorbent material (e.g., 4 inch by 4 inch gauze pad), wet with either the hypochlorite solution described above, or with 70 percent alcohol (isopropanol or ethanol). The surfaces should remain wet for at least 30 seconds before they are wiped dry with a second piece of clean, absorbent material. NOTE: Although highly bactericidal, alcohols are not considered to be broad-spectrum agents, and use of alcohols here is recommended primarily as an aid in mechanical cleaning; also, in a short contact period, alcohols may not be effective against bacteria or other pathogens. Nonetheless, in the context of vigorous cleaning with alcohol and absorbent material, little visible microbial contamination is likely after the cleaning procedure. <P>

People responsible for the use and maintenance of CPR mannequins should be encouraged not to rely totally on the mere presence of a disinfectant to protect them and their students from cross-infection during training programs. Emphasis should be placed on the necessity of thorough physical cleaning (scrubbing, wiping) as the first step in an effective decontamination protocol. Microbial contamination is easily removed from smooth, nonporous surfaces by using disposable cleaning cloths moistened with a detergent solution, and there is no evidence that a soaking procedure alone in a liquid is as effective as the same procedure accompanied by vigorous scrubbing. <P>

With specific regard to concerns about potential for hepatitis B and AIDS transmission in CPR training, it has recently been shown that the hepatitis B virus is not as resistant to disinfectant chemicals as it was once thought to be. Recent studies have shown that the retroviral agent that causes AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is comparatively delicate and is inactivated in less than 10 minutes at room temperature by a number of disinfectant chemicals, including the recommended agents, alcohol and sodium hypochlorite. Coupled with scrubbing and rinsing with soap and water, the sodium hypochlorite dilution will ensure that HIV, as well as a wide variety of other infectious agents with potential for contaminating mannequin surfaces, will be killed. In fact, if the steps in recommendation 8, above, are consistently followed, the students in each class should be presented with mannequins having a sanitary quality equal to or better than eating utensils in a properly operated restaurant. A higher level of surface disinfection is not warranted, and the recommended disinfectant chemicals (alcohol and household bleach) are safe, effective, inexpensive, easily obtained, and well tolerated by students, instructors, and mannequin surfaces when properly used. <P>
</OL>

Policy for minimizing risk of transmission of AIDS during actual CPR:<P>
<UL>
No transmission of hepatitis B virus infection during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation has been documented. However, because of the theoretical risk of salivary transmission of HIV during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, special attention should be given to the use of disposable airway equipment or resuscitation hags and the wearing of gloves when in contact with blood or other body fluids. Resuscitation equipment and devices known or suspected to be contaminated with blood or other body fluids should be used one and disposed of or be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after each use. <P>

Clear plastic face masks with one-way valves are available for use during mouth-to-mask ventilation. These masks provide diversion of the victim's exhaled gas away from the rescuer and may be used by health-care providers and public safety personnel properly trained in their use during two-person rescue, in place of mouth-to-mouth ventilation. The need for and effectiveness of this adjunct in preventing transmission of an infectious disease during mouth-to-mouth ventilation are unknown. If this type of device is to be used as reassurance to the rescuer that a potential risk might be minimized, the rescuer must be adequately trained in its use, especially with respect to making an adequate seal on the face and maintaining a patent airway. Such a device required two hands to secure a proper face seal and to maintain an open airway. As an additional precaution, the rescuer may elect to wear latex gloves because saliva or blood on the victim's mouth or face may be transferred to the rescuer's hands.
