<U>Elements of an adequate respirator inspection, cleaning, maintenance, and storage program</u>
<P>
Scrupulous respirator maintenance must be made an integral part of the overall respirator program.  Wearing poorly maintained or malfunctioning respirators, in one sense, is more dangerous than not wearing a respirator at all.  Workers wearing a defective device think they are protected when, in reality, they are not.
<P>
The industrial hygienist must strongly emphasize the importance of an adequate maintenance program, but permit its tailoring to the type of plant, working conditions, and hazards involved.  However, all programs are required to include at least:
<UL>
<LI>Inspection for defects (including a leak check)
<LI>Cleaning and disinfecting
<LI>Repair
<LI>Storage
</UL>
<P>
<U>Inspection for Defects</U>
<P>
Probably the most important part of a respirator maintenance program is continual inspection of the devices.  If conscientiously performed, inspections will identify damaged or malfunctioning respirators before they can be used.  The OSHA requirement outlines two primary types of inspection -- while the respirator is in use, and while it is being cleaned.  In a small operation where the worker probably maintains his own respirator, the two types of inspection become essentially one and the same.  In a large organization with a central respirator maintenance facility, the inspections may differ.
<P>
<U>Frequency of Inspection</U>
<P>
All respirators should be inspected before and after each use.  Those used routinely, i.e., emergency escape and rescue devices, shall be inspected after each use and at least once a month.
<P>
<U>Inspection Procedures</U>
<P>
Here we will divide inspection procedures into "field" inspection, and use during routine cleaning, and air-purifying and atmosphere-supplying devices.  The standards state only that respirator inspections shall include:
<UL>
<LI>A check of the tightness of the connections.
<LI>A check of the facepiece valves, connecting tube, and canisters.
</UL>
<P>
<U>Field Inspection</U>
<P>
Air-Purifying Respirators
<P>
Routinely used air-purifying respirators should be checked as follows before and after each use.
<p>
1. Examine the facepiece for:<BR>
<ul>
<LI>Excessive dirt 
<LI>Cracks, tears, holes, or distortion from improper storage
<LI>Inflexibility (stretch and message to restore flexibility)
<LI>Cracked or badly scratched lenses in full facepiece
<LI>Incorrectly mounted full facepiece lens or broken or missing mounting clips
<LI>Cracked or broken air-purifying element holder(s), badly worn threads, or missing gasket(s) (if required)
</UL>
<p>
2. Examine the head straps or head harness for:<BR>
<ul>
<LI>Breaks 
<LI>Loss of elasticity
<LI>Broken or malfunctioning buckles and attachments
<LI>Excessively worn serrations on the head harness which might permit slippage
</UL>
<p>
3. Examine the exhalation valve for the following after removing its cover:<BR>
<ul>
<LI>Foreign material, such as detergent residue, dust particles, or human hair under the valve seat
<LI>Cracks, breaks, or chips in the valve body, particularly in the sealing surface
<LI>Missing or defective valve cover
<LI>Improper installation of the valve in the valve body
</UL><p>
4. Examine the air-purifying elements for:<BR>
<ul>
<LI>Incorrect cartridge, canister, or filter for the hazard
<LI>Incorrect installation, loose connections, missing worn gaskets, or cross-threading in holder
<LI>Expired shelf-life date on cartridge or canister
<LI>Cracks or dents in outside case of filter, cartridge, or canister
<LI>Evidence of prior use of sorbent cartridge or canister, indicated by absence of sealing material, tape, foil, etc., over inlet
</UL>
<p>
5. If the device has a corrugated breathing tube, examine it for:<BR>
<ul>
<LI>Broken or missing end connectors
<LI>Missing or loose hose clamps
<LI>Deterioration, determined by stretching the tube and looking for cracks
</ul>
<p>
6. Examine the harness of a front- or back-mounted gas mask for:<BR>
<ul>
<LI>Damage or wear to the canister holder which may prevent its being held securely in place
<LI>Broken harness straps or fastenings
</UL>
<P>
When an air-purifying device is used non-routinely, all of the above procedures should be followed after each use.  If defects are found during any field inspection, two remedies are possible.  If the defect is minor, repair and/or adjustment may be made on the spot.  If it is major, the device should be removed from service until it can be repaired.  Under no circumstances should a device that is known to be defective be used.
<P>
Because respirator cleaning usually involves some disassembly, it presents a good opportunity to examine each respirator thoroughly.  The procedures outlined above for a field inspection should be used, but a pre-cleaning check would not normally include an operational check, which obviously should be done just before the device is returned to service.  Therefore, it is suggested that the inspection be made after the respirator is cleaned.
<p>
<u>Cleaning and Sanitizing</u>
<p>
Any good detergent may be used, but cleaner and sanitizing solutions that clean effectively and contain a bactericide are available.  The bactericide is generally a quaternary ammonium compound, which has some disadvantages, because its concentration must be adjusted to the composition of the local water to provide a constant degree of disaffection.  Also, there is a possibility of dermatitis if the quaternary ammonium salts are not completely rinsed from the respirator.
<p>
An alternative is to wash the respirator in detergent, followed by a disinfecting rinse.  Disinfection is not absolutely necessary if the respirator is reused by the same worker.  However, where individual issue is not practiced, disinfecting is strongly recommended.  Reliable, effective disinfectants may be made from readily available household solutions, including:
<ul>
<li>Hypochlorite solution (50 ppm of chloride) made by adding approximately 2 ml of Chlorox to 1 liter of water or, in kitchen language, 2 tablespoons per gallon.  A 2-minute immersion disinfects the respirators.
<li>Aqueous solution of iodine (50 ppm of iodine) made by adding approximately 0.8 ml tincture of iodine per liter of water.  The iodine is approximately 7% ammonium and potassium iodide, 45% alcohol, and 48% water.  An equivalent expression is approximately 1 teaspoon of tincture of iodine per gallon of water.  Again, a 2-minute immersion is sufficient.
</ul>
<p>
<u>Rinsing</u>
<p>
The cleaned and disinfected respirator should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water (140 F maximum) to remove all traces of detergent, cleaner and sanitizer, and disinfectant.  This is very important to prevent dermatitis.
<p>
<u>Drying</u>
<p>
The respirators may be allowed to dry by themselves on a clean surface.  They also may be hung from a horizontal wire, like drying clothes, but care must be taken not to damage the facepieces.
<p>
<u>Reassemble and Inspection</u>
<p>
The clean dry respirator facepiece should be reassembled and inspected in an area separate from the disassembly area to avoid contamination.  The inspection has been discussed, but there may be more things to look for because of the cleaning.  The most common is detergent or soap residue left by inadequate rinsing.  This appears most often under the seat of the exhalation valve, and can cause valve leakage or sticking.
<p>
At this time, the respirators should be thoroughly inspected and all defects corrected.  New or retested filters, or new cartridges and canisters, should be installed, and the completely reassembled respirator should be tested for leaks.
<p>
<u>Maintenance and Repair</u>
<p>
The OSHA standards state that "replacement or repairs shall be done by experienced persons with parts designed for the respirator."  Besides being contrary to OSHA requirements, substitution of parts from a different brad or type of respirator invalidates approval of the device. Therefore, the user would be wearing an unapproved device, in violation of the OSHA requirement.
<p>
An important aspect of any maintenance program is having enough spare parts on hand.  Only continual surveillance of replacement rate will determine what parts in what quantities must be kept in stock.  It is desirable to have some sort of record keeping system to indicate spare parts usage and the inventory.
<p>
<u>Storage</u>
<p>
All the care that has gone into cleaning and maintenance of a respirator can be negated by improper storage.  OSHA requires that respirators be stored to protect against:
<ul>
<li>Dust
<li>Sunlight
<li>Heat
<li>Extreme cold
<li>Excessive moisture
<li>Damaging chemicals
</ul>
<P>
It is strongly recommended that freshly cleaned respirators be placed in heat-sealed or reusable plastic bags until reissue.  They should be stored in a clean, dry location away from direct sunlight.  They should be stored in a single layer with the facepiece and exhalation valve in a more or less normal position to prevent the rubber or plastic from taking a permanent distorted "set."
<P>
Air-purifying respirators kept for non-routine or emergency use should be stored in a cabinet in individual compartments.
<P>
The storage cabinet should be readily accessible, and all workers should be made aware of its location, as is done for fire extinguishers.  Avoidance of serious injury from inhalation of a toxic substance may depend entirely on how quickly workers can be encourage for routinely used respirators if it does not interfere with the normal work routine.  A little inconvenience here is justified to prevent use of respirators damaged by improper storage.
<P>
Routinely used respirators may be stored in a variety of ways if they are protected against the substances and conditions listed at the beginning of this section.  This means that when a respirator is not in use, it should be stored in a plastic bag inside a rigid container.  If workers are trained adequately, they should develop a respect for their respirator that will automatically give them incentive to protect them from damage.  Besides providing better assurance of adequate protection, this training will lower maintenance costs because of decreased damage.
