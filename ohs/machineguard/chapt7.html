<b>Cellular Manufacturing Systems</b>
<p>
A recent development in manufacturing technology has given rise to a 
manufacturing concept known as Manufacturing Systems/Cells, or Cellular 
Manufacturing Systems.  These systems of integrated industrial machines, 
linked by a material handling system and operated by (controlled by) a 
programmable electronic system (computer) are capable of manufacturing 
discrete parts or assemblies.  The safety of employees exposed to these 
systems is of first order importance.
<p>
Because a system is to be safeguarded it is logical that a system hazard 
analysis will yield the parameters of the safeguarding system required.  
Figures 73 through 75 depict typical cellular system concepts and 
safeguarding considerations.
<p>
ANSI B11.20-1991, should be referred to for assistance when a cellular 
manufacturing system is envisioned.
