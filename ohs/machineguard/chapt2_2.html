<b>Safety Trip Controls</b>
<p>
Safety trip controls provide a quick means for deactivating the machine in 
an emergency situation.
<p>
A pressure-sensitive body bar, when depressed, will deactivate the 
machine.  If the operator or anyone trips, loses balance, or is drawn 
toward the machine, applying pressure to the bar will stop the operation.  
The positioning of the bar, therefore, is critical.  It must stop the 
machine before a part of the employee's body reaches the danger area.  
<a href="gif/mach40.gif">Figure 40</a> shows a pressure-sensitive body bar located on the front of a 
rubber mill.
<p>
When pressed by hand, the safety deactivates the machine.  Because the 
triprod has to be actuated by the operator during an emergency situation, 
its proper position is also critical.  <a href="gif/mach41.gif">Figure 41</a> shows a triprod located 
above the rubber mill.  <a href="gif/mach42.gif">Figure 42</a> shows another application of a triprod.
<p>
Safety tripwire cables are located around the perimeter of or near the 
danger area.  The operator must be able to reach the cable with either 
hand to stop the machine.  <a href="gif/mach43.gif">Figure 43</a> shows a calender equipped with this 
type of control, while <a href="gif/mach44.gif">Figure 44</a> shows a tomato sorter with a safety 
tripwire cable.
<p>
All of these tripwire rods or other safety devices must be manually reset 
to restart the machine.  Simply releasing the tripwire to restart the 
machine will not ensure that the employee is out of danger when the 
machine restarts.
<p>
<b>Two-Hand Control</b>
<p>
The two-hand control requires constant, concurrent pressure by the 
operator to activate the machine.  This kind of control requires a 
part-revolution clutch, brake, and a brake monitor if used on a power 
press as shown in <a href="gif/mach45.gif">Figure 45</a>.  With this type of device, the operator's 
hands are required to be at a safe location (on control buttons) and at a 
safe distance from the danger area while the machine completes its closing 
cycle.

<p>
<b>Two-Hand Trip</b>
<p>
The two-hand trip in <a href="gif/mach46.gif">Figure 46</a> requires concurrent application of both the 
operator's control buttons to activate the machine cycle, after which the 
hands are free.  This device is usually used with machines equipped with 
full-revolution clutches.  The trips must be placed far enough from the 
point of operation to make it impossible for the operator to move his or 
her hands from the trip buttons or handles into the point of operation 
before the first half of the cycle is completed.  The distance from the 
trip button depends upon the speed of the cycle and the band speed 
constant.  Thus the operator's hands are kept far enough away to prevent 
them from being placed in the danger area prior to the slide/ram or blade 
reaching the full "down" position.
<p>
To be effective, both two-hand controls and trips must be located so that 
the operator cannot use two hands or one hand and another part of his/her 
body to trip the machine.
<p>
<b>Gate</b>
<p>
A gate is a movable barrier that protects the operator at the point of 
operation before the machine cycle can be started.  Gates are, in many 
instances, designed to be operated with each machine cycle.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach47.gif">Figure 47</a> shows a horizontal injection molding machine with a gate.  To 
be effective, the gate must be interlocked so that the machine will not 
begin a cycle unless the gate guard is in place.  It must be in the closed 
position before the machine can function.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach48.gif">Figure 48</a> shows a gate on a power press.  If the gate is not permitted to 
descend to the fully closed position, the press will not function.
<p>
Another potential application of this type of guard is where the gate is a 
component of a perimeter safeguarding system.  Here the gate may provide 
protection not only to the operator but to pedestrian traffic as well.
<p>
<b>Safeguarding by Location/Distance</b>
<p>
The examples mentioned below are a few of the numerous applications of the 
principle of safeguarding by location/distance.  A thorough hazard 
analysis of each machine and particular situation is absolutely essential 
before attempting this safeguarding technique.
<p>
To consider a part of a machine to be safeguarded by location, the 
dangerous moving part of a machine must be so positioned that those areas 
are not accessible or do not present a hazard to a worker during the 
normal operation of the machine.  This may be accomplished by locating a 
machine so that the hazardous parts of the machine are located away from 
operator work stations or other areas where employees walk or work.  This 
can be accomplished by positioning a machine with its power transmission 
apparatus against a wall and leaving all routine operations conducted on 
the other side of the machine.  Additionally, enclosure walls or fences 
can restrict access to machines.  Another possible solution is to have 
dangerous parts located high enough to be out of the normal reach of any 
worker.
<p>
The feeding process can be safeguarded by location if a safe distance can 
be maintained to protect the worker's hands.  The dimensions of the stock 
being worked on may provide adequate safety.
<p>
For instance, if the stock is several feet long and only one end of the 
stock is being worked on, the operator may be able to hold the opposite 
end while the work is being performed.  An example would be a single-end 
punching machine.  However, depending upon the machine, protection might 
still be required for another personnel.
<p>
The positioning of the operator's control station provides another 
potential approach to safeguarding by location.  Operator controls may be 
located at a safe distance from the machine if there is no reason for the 
operator to tend it.
<p>
<b>Feeding the Ejection Methods to Improve Operator Safety</b>
<p>
Many feeding and ejection methods do not require the operator to place his 
or her hands in the danger area.  In some cases, no operator involvement is 
necessary after the machine is set up.  In other situations, operators can 
manually feed the stock with the assistance of a feeding mechanism.  
Properly designed ejection methods do not require any operator involvement 
after the machine starts to function.
<p>
Some feeding and ejection methods may even create hazards themselves.  For 
instance, a robot may eliminate the need for an operator to be near the 
machine but may create a new hazard itself by the movement of its arm.
<p>
Using these feeding and ejection methods does not eliminate the need for 
guards and devices.  Guards and devices must be used wherever they are 
necessary and possible in order to provide protection from exposure to 
hazards.
<p>
Types of feeding and ejection methods...
<p>
Automatic feeds reduce the exposure of the operator during the work 
process, and sometimes do not require any effort by the operator after the 
machine is set up and running.
<p>
In <a href="gif/mach49.gif">Figure 49</a>, the power press has an automatic feeding mechanism.  Notice 
the transparent fixed enclosure guard at the danger area.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach50.gif">Figure 50</a> shows a saw with an automatic indexing mechanism that moves the 
stock a predetermined distance for each cut.  The traveling head 
automatically recycles for each cut.
<p>
With semiautomatic feeding, as in the case of a power press, the operator 
uses a mechanism to place the piece being processed under the ram at each 
stroke.  The operator does not need to reach into the danger area, and the 
danger area is completely enclosed.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach51.gif">Figure 51</a> shows a chute feed.  It may be either a horizontal or an 
inclined chute into which each piece is placed by hand.  Using a chute 
feed on an inclined press not only helps center the piece as it slides 
into the die, but may also simplify the problem of ejection.
<p>
A plunger feed is shown in <a href="gif/mach52.gif">Figure 52</a>.  The blanks or pieces are placed in 
the nest one at a time by the plunger with pushes them under the slide.  
Plunger feeds are useful for operations on irregularly shaped workpieces 
which will not stack in a magazine or will not slide easily down a gravity 
chute.  The mechanism shown is mechanically connected to the press 
tripping mechanism.  When the plunger is pushed in, pin "B" is allowed to 
rise up into hole "A," allowing yoke "C" to release so the press can be 
tripped.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach53.gif">Figure 53</a> shows a plunger and magazine feed.  Slot "A" must be in 
alignment with interlock "B" before the press can be tripped.
<p>
The sliding die in <a href="gif/mach54.gif">Figure 54</a> is pulled toward the operator for safe 
feeding and then pushed into position under the slide prior to the 
downward stroke.  The die moves in and out by hand or by a foot lever.  
The die should be interlocked with the press to prevent tripping when the 
die is out of alignment with the slide.  Providing "stops" will prevent 
the die from being inadvertently pulled out of the slides.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach55.gif">Figure 55</a> shows a sliding bolster.  The press bed is modified with a 
hydraulically or pneumatically controlled bolster that slides in when 
"start" buttons are depressed, and out when the stroke is completed.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach56.gif">Figure 56</a> shows a double-dial feed.  The dials revolve with each stroke of 
the press.  The operator places the part to be processed in a nest on the 
dial which is positioned in front of the die.  The dial is indexed with 
each upstroke of the press to deliver the nested part into the die.
<p>
Automatic ejection may employ either an air-pressure or a mechanical 
apparatus to remove the completed part from a press.  It may be 
interlocked with the operating controls to prevent operation until part 
ejection is completed.  This method requires additional safeguards for 
full protection of the operator
<p>
As shown in <a href="gif/mach57.gif">Figure 57</a>, the pan shuttle mechanism moves under the finished 
part as the slide moves toward the "up" position.  The shuttle then 
catches the part stripped from the slide by the knockout pins and deflects 
it into a chute.  When the ram moves down toward the next blank, the pan 
shuttle moves away from the die area.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach58.gif">Figures 58</a> and <a
href="gif/mach59.gif">59</a> show air ejection and mechanical ejection mechanisms, 
respectively.  Note: Air ejection methods often present a noise hazard to 
operators.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach60.gif">Figure 60</a> shows a semiautomatic ejection mechanism used on a power press.  
When the plunger is withdrawn from the die area, the ejector leg, which is 
mechanically coupled to the plunger, kicks the completed work out.
<p>
Essentially, robots perform work that would otherwise have to be done by 
an operator.  They are best used in high-production processes requiring 
repeated routines where they prevent other hazards to employees.  However, 
they may create hazards themselves, and if they do, appropriate guards 
must be used.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach61.gif">Figures 61</a>, <a
href="gif/mach62.gif">62</a>, and <a
href="gif/mach63.gif">63</a>, respectively, show a type of robot in operation, 
the danger areas it can create, and an example of the kind of task 
(feeding a press) it can perform.

<b>Miscellaneous Aids</b>
<p>
While these aids do not give complete protection from machine hazards, 
they may provide the operator with an extra margin of safety.  Sound 
judgment is needed in their application and usage.  Below are several 
examples of possible applications.
<p>
An awareness barrier does not provide physical protection, but serves only 
to remind a person that he or she is approaching the danger area.  
Generally, awareness barriers are not considered adequate when continual 
exposure to the hazard exists.
<p>
<a href="gif/mach64.gif">Figure 64</a> shows a rope used as an awareness barrier on the rear of a power 
squaring shear.  Although the barrier does not physically prevent a person 
from entering the danger area, it calls attention to it.  For an employee 
to enter the danger area, it calls attention to it.  For an employee to 
enter the danger area, an overt act must take place, that is, the employee 
must either reach or step over, under or through the barrier.
<p>
Shields, another aid, may be used to provide protection from flying 
particles, splashing cutting oils, or coolants.  <a href="gif/mach66.gif">Figure 66</a> shows several 
potential applications.
<p>
Special hand tools may be used to place or remove stock, particularly from 
or into the point of operation of a machine.  A typical use would be for 
reaching into the danger area of a press or press brake.  <a href="gif/mach67.gif">Figure 67</a> shows 
an assortment of tools for this purpose.  Holding tools should not be used 
instead of other machine safeguards; they are merely a supplement to the 
protection that other guards provide.
<p>
A push stick or block, such as those in <a href="gif/mach68.gif">Figure 68</a>, may be used when 
feeding stock into a saw blade.  When it becomes necessary for hands to be 
in close proximity to the blade, the push stick or block may provide a few 
inches of safety and prevent a severe injury.  In the illustration the 
push block fits over the fence.
