<b>Worker Rights and Responsibilities</b>
<p>
If you are a worker, you have the right to:
<ul>
<li>request an OSHA inspection for workplace hazards, violations of
     OSHA standards, or violations of the OSH Act (your name will be 
     kept confidential on request);
<li>have an authorized employee representative accompany the OSHA 
     compliance officer on the workplace inspection;
<li>confer informally with the OSHA compliance officer (in private, 
     if preferred);
<li>be notified by your employer of any citations issued for alleged 
     violations of standards at the workplace, and of your employer's
     requests for variances or for changes in the abatement period;
<li>contest the abatement time set in any citation issued to your 
     employer by OSHA;
<li>file a complaint with OSHA if you believe that you have been 
     dismissed, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against for
     exercising rights under OSHA;
<li>file a complaint with Federal OSHA authorities if your State
     agency fails to administer a State program as effectively as 
     required by OSHA;
<li>ask OSHA about any tests performed in your workplace, the results
     of inspections, and any decision not to take action on a complaint;
<li>receive information from your employer about hazards and safety 
     measures applicable to the workplace, OSHA standards relevant to 
     your job, and the record of accidents and illnesses in the 
     workplace;
<li>ask that National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
     evaluate and provide information on the substances used in your 
     workplace;
<li>refuse to work in an imminent danger situation, under certain 
     conditions;
<li>submit written information or comment to OSHA on the issuance, 
     revocation, or modification of an OSHA standard and to request 
     a public hearing; and
<li>observe the monitoring and measuring of toxic substances in the 
     workplace if you are exposed, and to have access to any records  
     of your exposure.
</ul>
<p>
You also have the responsibility to:

<ul>
<li>read the OSHA poster in the workplace;
<li>comply with all the OSHA standards, with all requirements of your 
     State-approved plan (if any), and with the employer's safety and
     health rules;
<li>report any hazards immediately to your supervisor,
<li>report to your supervisor any job-related illness or injury; and
<li>cooperate fully with the OSHA compliance officer who inspects your 
     workplace.
</ul>
