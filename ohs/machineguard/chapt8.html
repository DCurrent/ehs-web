<b>Ergonomic Considerations of Machine Safeguarding</b>
<p>
The ergonomic considerations of machine safeguarding are as significant to 
the safety and health of the worker as are the multitude of techniques to 
accomplish safety and health in the workplace.  Worker stress and fatigue 
can be averted by creditable work setups and well integrated safeguarding. 
The various industry consensus standards are only now beginning to address 
this issue.  Future evaluations of safeguarding are likely to devote more 
attention to this aspect.
