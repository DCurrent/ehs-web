<b>Robot Applications</b>
<p>
Robots are machines that load and unload stock, assemble parts, transfer 
objects, or perform other tasks.
<p>
Robots are used for replacing humans who were performing unsafe, 
hazardous, highly repetitive, and unpleasant tasks.  They are utilized to 
accomplish many different types of application functions such as material 
handling, assembly, arc welding, resistance welding, machine tool 
load/unload functions, painting/spraying, etc.
<p>
Studies in Sweden and Japan indicate that many robot accidents have not 
occurred under normal operating conditions but rather during programming, 
program touch-up, maintenance, repair, testing, setup, or adjustment.  
During many of these operations, the operator, programmer or corrective 
maintenance worker may temporarily be within the robot's working envelope 
where unintended operations could result in injuries.
<p>
All industrial robots are either servo or non-servo controlled.  Servo 
robots are controlled through the use of sensors which are employed to 
continually monitor the robot's axes for positional and velocity feedback 
information.  This feedback information is compared on an on-going basis 
to pre-taught information which has been programmed and stored in the 
robot's memory.
<p>
Non-servo robots do not have the feedback capability of monitoring the 
robot's axes and velocity and comparing with a pre-taught program.  Their 
axes are controlled through a system of mechanical stops and limit 
switches to control the robot's movement.
<p>
<b>Type of Potential Hazards</b>
<p>
The use of robotics in the workplace also can pose potential mechanical 
and human hazards.
<p>
Mechanical hazards might include workers colliding with equipment, being 
crushed, or trapped by equipment, or being injured by falling equipment 
components.  For example, a worker could collide with the robot's arm or 
peripheral equipment as a result of unpredicted movements, component 
malfunctions, or unpredicted program changes.
<p>
A worker could be injured by being trapped between the robot's arm and 
other peripheral equipment or being crushed by peripheral equipment as a 
result of being impacted by the robot into this equipment.
<p>
Mechanical hazards also can result from the mechanical failure of 
components associated with the robot or its power source, drive 
components, tooling or end-effector, and/or peripheral equipment.  The 
failure of gripper mechanisms with resultant release of parts, or the 
failure of end-effector power tools such as grinding wheels, buffing 
wheels, deburring tools, power screwdrivers, and nut runners to name a 
few.
<p>
Human errors can result in hazards both to personnel and equipment.  
Errors in programming, interfacing peripheral equipment, connecting 
input/output sensors, can all result in unpredicted movement or action by 
the robot which can result in personnel injury or equipment breakage.
<p>
Human errors in judgment result frequently from incorrectly activating the 
teach pendant or control panel.  The greatest human judgment error results 
from becoming so familiar with the robot's redundant motions that 
personnel are too trusting in assuming the nature of these motions and 
place themselves in hazardous positions while programming or performing 
maintenance within the robot's work envelope.
<p>
Robots in the workplace are generally associated with the machine tools or 
process equipment.  <b>Robots are machines,</b> and as such must be 
safeguarded in ways similar to those presented for any hazardous remotely 
controlled machine.
<p>
Various techniques are available to prevent employee exposure to the 
hazards which can be imposed by robots.  The most common technique is 
through the installation of perimeter guarding with interlocked gates.  A 
critical parameter relates to the manner in which the interlocks function. 
Of major concern is whether the computer program, control circuit, or the 
primary power circuit, is interrupted when an interlock is activated.  The 
various industry standards should be investigated for guidance; however, 
it is generally accepted that the primary motive power to the robot should 
be interrupted by the interlock.
<p>
The ANSI safety standard for industrial robots, ANSI/RIA R15.06-1986, is 
very informative and presents certain basic requirements for protecting 
the worker.  However, when a robot is to be used in a workplace, the 
employer should accomplish a comprehensive operational safety/health 
hazard analysis and then devise and implement an effective safeguarding 
system which is fully responsive to the situation.  (Various effective 
safeguarding techniques are described in ANSI B11.19-1990.)
