<b>Methods of Machine Safeguarding</b>
<p>
There are many ways to safeguard machines.  The type of operation, the 
size or shape of stock, the method of handling, the physical layout of the 
work area, the type of material, and production requirements or 
limitations will help to determine the appropriate safeguarding method for 
the individual machine.
<p>
As a general rule, power transmission apparatus is best protected by fixed
guards that enclose the danger areas.  For hazards at the point of 
operation, where moving parts actually perform work on stock, several 
kinds of safeguarding may be possible.  One must always choose the most 
effective and practical means available.
<p>
We can group safeguards under five general classifications.

<b>Guards</b>
<p>
Guards are barriers which prevent access to danger areas.  There are four 
general types of guards:
<p>
Fixed:  As its name implies, a fixed guard is a permanent part of the 
machine.  It is not dependent upon moving parts to perform its intended 
function.  It may be constructed of sheet metal, screen, wire cloth, bars, 
plastic, or any other material that is substantial enough to withstand 
whatever impact it may receive and to endure prolonged use.  This guard is 
usually preferable to all other types because of its relative simplicity 
and permanence.
<p>
Examples of fixed guards...
<p>
In <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach11.gif">Figure 11</a>, a fixed guard on a power press completely encloses the point 
of operation.  The stock is fed through the side of the guard into the die 
area, with the scrap stock exiting on the opposite side.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach12.gif">Figure 12</a> shows a fixed guard that protects the operator from a mechanism 
that folds cartons.  This guard would not normally be removed except to 
perform maintenance on the machine.  <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach13.gif">Figure 13</a> shows a fixed enclosure 
guard shielding the belt and pulley of a power transmission unit.  An 
inspection panel is provided on top in order to minimize the need for 
removing the guard.  To remain effective, the inspection panel cannot be 
removed while the mechanism is in operation.  In <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach14.gif">Figure 14</a>, fixed 
enclosure guards are shown on a bandsaw.  These guards protect the 
operator from the turning wheels and moving saw blade.  Normally, the only 
time for the guards to be opened or removed would be for a blade change or 
maintenance.  It is very important that they be securely fastened while 
the saw is in use.
<p>
A fixed guard is shown on a veneer clipper in <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach15.gif">Figure 15</a>.  This guard acts 
as a barrier, protecting fingers from exposure to the blade.  Note the 
side view of the curved portion of the guard.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach16.gif">Figure 16</a> shows both a fixed blade guard and a throat and gap guard on a 
power squaring shear.  These guards should be removed only for maintenance 
or blade changes.
<p>
In <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach17.gif">Figure 17</a>, a transparent, fixed barrier guard is being used on a press 
brake to protect the operator from the unused portions of the die.  This 
guard is easy to install or remove.
<p>
Interlocked:  When this type of guard is opened or removed, the tripping 
mechanism and/or power automatically shuts off or disengages, and the 
machine cannot cycle or be started until the guard is back in place.
<p>
An interlocked guard may use electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, or 
pneumatic power or any combination of these.  Interlocks should not 
prevent "inching" by remote control if required.  Replacing the guard 
should not automatically restart the machine.  To be effective, all 
movable guards should be interlocked to prevent occupational hazards.
(See also <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach13.gif">Figure 13.</a>)
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach18.gif">Figure 18</a> shows an interlocked barrier guard mounted on an automatic 
bread bagging machine.  When the guard is removed, the machine will not 
function.
<p>
In <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach19.gif">Figure 19</a>, the beater mechanism of a picker machine (used in the 
textile industry) is covered by an interlocked barrier guard.  This guard 
cannot be raised while the machine is running, nor can the machine be 
restarted with the guard in the raised position.
<p>
In <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach20.gif">Figure 20</a>, an interlocked guard covers the rotating cylinder of the 
dividing head of a roll make-up machine used for making hamburger and 
hot-dog rolls.
<p>
Adjustable:  Adjustable guards are useful because they allow flexibility 
in accommodating various sizes of stock.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach21.gif">Figure 21</a> shows a bandsaw with an adjustable guard to protect the operator 
from the unused portion of the blade.  This guard can be adjusted 
according to the size of stock.
<p>
In <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach22.gif">Figure 22</a>, the bars adjust to accommodate the size and shape of the 
stock.  <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach23.gif">Figures 23</a> and <a
href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach24.gif">24</a> show guards that can be adjusted according to 
the thickness of the stock.
<p>
In <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach25.gif">Figure 25</a>, the guard adjusts to provide a barrier between the operator 
and the blade.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach26.gif">Figure 26</a> shows an adjustable enclosure guard on a bandsaw.
<p>
Self-Adjusting:  The openings of these barriers are determined by the 
movement of the stock.  As the operator moves the stock into the danger 
area, the guard is pushed away, providing an opening which is only large 
enough to admit the stock.  After the stock is removed, the guard returns 
to the rest position.  This guard protects the operator by placing a 
barrier between the danger area and the operator.  The guards may be 
constructed of plastic, metal, or other substantial material.  
Self-adjusting guards offer different degrees of protection.
<p>
Examples of self-adjusting guards...
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach27.gif">Figure 27</a> shows a radial arm saw with a self-adjusting guard.  As the 
blade is pulled across the stock, the guard moves up, staying in contact 
with the stock.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach28.gif">Figure 28</a> shows a twin-action, transparent, self-adjusting guard.  The 
first guard rises as the stock enters, then returns to its rest position 
as the stock moves ahead to raise the second guard.
<p>
A self-adjusting guard is shown in <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach29.gif">Figure 29</a>.  As the blade moves through 
the stock, the guard rises up to the stock surface.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach30.gif">Figure 30</a> shows a self-adjusting enclosure guard mounted on a jointer.  
This guard is moved from the cutting head by the stock.  After the stock 
is removed, the guard will return, under spring tension, to the rest 
position.
<p>
Another type of self-adjusting guard mounted on a jointer is illustrated 
in <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach31.gif">Figure 31</a>.  The guard moves two ways.  An edging operation causes the 
guard to move horizontally.  If the stock is wide enough during a 
surfacing operation, the stock may be fed under the guard, causing it to 
move vertically.

<b>Devices</b>
<p>
A safety device may perform one of several functions.  It may stop the 
machine if a hand or any part of the body is inadvertently placed in the 
danger area; restrain or withdraw the operator's hands from the danger 
area during operation; require the operator to use both hands on machine 
controls, thus keeping both hands and body out of danger; or provide a 
barrier which is synchronized with the operating cycle of the machine in 
order to prevent entry to the danger area during the hazardous part of the 
cycle.
<p>
<b>Presence-Sensing</b>
<p>
The photoelectric (optical) presence-sensing device uses a system of light 
sources and controls which can interrupt the machine's operating cycle.  
If the light field is broken, the machine stops and will not cycle.  This 
device must be used only on machines which can be stopped before the 
worker can reach the danger area.  The design and placement of the guard 
depends upon the time it takes to stop the mechanism and the speed at 
which the employee's hand can reach across the distance from the guard to 
the danger zone.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach32.gif">Figure 32</a> shows a photoelectric presence-sending device on a 
part-revolution power press. When the light beam is broken, either the ram 
will not start to cycle, or, if the cycle has begun, the stopping 
mechanism will be activated so that the press stops before the operator's 
hand can enter the danger zone.
<p>
A photoelectric presence-sending device used with a press brake is 
illustrated in <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach33.gif">Figure 33</a>.  The device may be swung up or down to 
accommodate different production requirements.
<p>
The radiofrequency (capacitance) presence-sending device uses a radio beam 
that is part of the machine control circuit.  When the capacitance field 
is broken, the machine will stop or will not activate.  Like the 
photoelectric device, this device shall only be used on machines which can 
be stopped before the worker can reach the danger area.  This requires the 
machine to have a friction clutch or other reliable means for stopping.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach34.gif">Figure 34</a> shows a radiofrequency presence-sensing device mounted on a 
part-revolution power press.
<p>
The electromechanical sensing device has a probe or contact bar which 
descends to a predetermined distance when the operator initiates the 
machine cycle.  If there is an obstruction preventing it from descending 
its full predetermined distance, the control circuit does not actuate the 
machine cycle.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach35.gif">Figure 35</a> shows an electromechanical sensing device on an eyeletter. The 
sensing probe in contact with the operator's finger is also shown.
<p>
<b>Pullback</b>
<p>
Pullback devices utilize a series of cables attached to the operator's 
hands, wrists, and/or arms.  This type of device is primarily used on 
machines with stroking action.  When the slide/ram is up between cycles, 
the operator is allowed access to the point of operation.  When the 
slide/ram begins to cycle by starting its descent, a mechanical linkage 
automatically assures withdrawal of the hands from the point of operation.
<p>
<a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach36.gif">Figure 36</a> shows a pullback device on a straight-side power press.  When the 
slide/ram is in the "up" position, the operator can feed material by hand 
into the point of operation.  When the press cycle is actuated, the 
operator's hands and arms are automatically withdrawn.  <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach37.gif">Figure 37</a> shows a 
pullback device on a smaller press.
<p>
A pullback device on a press brake is illustrated in <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach38.gif">Figure 38</a>.
<p>
<b>Restraint</b>
<p>
The restraint (holdout) device in <a href="//www.uky.edu/FiscalAffairs/Environmental/ohs/machineguard/gif/mach39.gif">Figure 39</a> utilizes cables or straps that 
are attached to the operator's hands at a fixed point.  The cables or 
straps must be adjusted to let the operator's hands travel within a 
predetermined safe area.  There is no extending or retracting action 
involved.  Consequently, hand-feeding tools are often necessary if the 
operation involves placing material into the danger area.
