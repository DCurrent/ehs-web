<b>The Utilization of Industry Consensus Standards</b>
<p>
OSHA uses industry consensus standards, related to the safe operation of 
equipment, as guidance of the industry accepted practice for safe 
operations.  Industry consensus standards which describe equipment 
configuration or design but which do not describe safe and/or healthful 
use and operation of the equipment are of limited assistance to OSHA.  In 
any event, even when an industry consensus standard addresses 
safety/health considerations, OSHA may determine that the safety/health 
practices described by that industry consensus standard are deficient when 
related to the requirement(s) set forth by the pertinent OSHA 
regulation(s).  However, many of the various ANSI safety standards devoted 
to the safe use of equipment and machines are pertinent and provide 
valuable guidance as they relate to the multitude of safe operating 
procedures regularly discussed in ANSI safety standards.
<p>
All of the requirements of <a href="//www.osha-slc.gov/OshStd_data/1910_0021.html">29 CFR 1910.21</a>, are applicable to machines
found in industry.  Paragraph (a)(1), requires that employees be protected
from the hazards created by the point of operation, ingoing nip points,
and rotating parts.  Paragraph (a)(2), describes the manner in which
guards shall be affixed.  The proper application of devices are not
described; therefore, other similar OSHA or pertinent industry standards
must be referred to for guidance.  Paragraph (a)(3) describes, with
particularity, the requirements for safeguarding the point of operation. 
<p>
<p>
The OSHA standard specifically requires that at the point of operation,
"the guarding device shall be in conformity with any appropriate standards
therefore, or in the absence of applicable specific standards, shall be so 
designed and constructed as to prevent the operator from having any part 
of his body in the danger zone during the operating cycle.  "Applicable 
standards include any similar OSHA standard or any OSHA adopted industry 
consensus standard(s) which provide for the safety of the operator during 
the operating cycle.  However, any specific industry consensus standard, 
such as an ANSI standard for the particular machine or equipment, should 
be used for guidance relative to the accepted procedures for safeguarding 
workers and operators from the recognized hazards of the equipment.
<p>
Employers who comply with the requirements of an industry consensus 
standard rather than a specific OSHA standard, where such compliance 
deviates from the OSHA requirements but provides for a more conservative 
safeguarding concept, are categorized as having created a de minimis 
violation of the specific OSHA standard. (A de minimis violation is a 
violation of an OSHA standard that has no direct or immediate relationship 
to safety or health.  Such de minimis violations require no correction and 
result in no penalty.)
<p>
OSHA encourages employers to abide by the more current industry consensus 
standards since those standards are more likely to be abreast of the state 
of the art than an applicable OSHA standard may be.  Furthermore, the 
industry consensus standards will usually discuss a variety of techniques 
for averting exposure to the identified hazards of the machine or process.
