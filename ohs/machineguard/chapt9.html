<b>Cooperation and Assistance</b>
<p>
Safety in the workplace demands cooperation and alertness on everyone's 
part.  Supervisors, operators, and other workers who notice hazards in need 
of safeguarding, or existing systems that need repair or improvement, 
should notify the proper authority immediately.
<p>
Supervisors have these additional, special responsibilities with regard to 
safety in the workplace; encouraging safe work habits and correcting 
unsafe ones; explaining to the worker all the potential hazards associated 
with the machines and processes in the work area; and being responsive to 
employer requests for action or information regarding machine hazards.  
The first-line supervisor plays a pivotal role in communicating the safety 
needs of the worker to management and the employer's safety rules and 
policies to the worker.
<p>
Sometimes the solution to a machine safeguarding problem may require 
expertise that is not available in a given establishment.  The readers of 
this manual are encouraged to find out where help is available and, when 
necessary, to request it.
<p>
The machine's manufacturer is often a good place to start when looking for 
assistance with a safeguarding problem.  Manufacturers can often supply 
the necessary literature or advice.  Insurance carriers, too, will often 
make their safety specialists available to the establishments whose assets 
they insure.  Union safety specialists can also lend significant 
assistance.
<p>
Some government agencies offer consultation services, providing for 
on-site evaluation of workplaces and the recommendation of possible hazard 
controls.  OSHA funds one such program, which is offered free of charge to 
employers in every state.  Delivered by state governments or private 
contractors, the consultation program is completely separate from the OSHA 
inspection effort; no citations are issued and no penalties are proposed.  
The trained professional consultants can help employers recognize hazards 
in the workplace and can suggest general approaches for solving safety and 
health problems.  In addition, the consultant can identify sources of 
other available help, if necessary.
<p>
Anyone with questions about Federal standards, about the requirements for 
machine safeguarding, or about available consultation services should 
contact OSHA.  (You can contact the Salt Lake City office at <A HREF="//www.osha.gov/">//www.osha.gov/</A>)
