<b>Guard Construction</b>
<p>
Today many builders of single-purpose machines provide point-of-operation 
and power transmission safeguards as standard equipment.  However, not all 
machines in use have built-in safeguards provided by the manufacturer.
<p>
Guards designed and installed by the builder offer two main advantages:
<ul>
<li>They usually conform to the design and function of the machine.
<li>They can be designed to strengthen the machine in some way or to 
     serve some additional functional purposes.
</ul>
<p>
User-built guards are sometimes necessary for a variety of reasons.  They 
have these advantages:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Often, with older machinery, they are the only practical safeguarding 
     solution.
<li>They may be the only choice for mechanical power transmission 
     apparatus in older plants, where machinery is not powered by 
     individual motor drives.
<li>They permit options for point-of-operation safeguards when skilled 
     personnel design and make them.
<li>They can be designed and built to fit unique and even changing 
     situations.
<li>They can be installed on individual dies and feeding mechanisms.
<li>Design and installation of machine safeguards by plant personnel can 
     help to promote safety consciousness in the workplace.
</ul>
<p>
However, they also have disadvantages:
<p>
<ul>
<li>User-built guards may not conform well to the configuration and 
     function of the machine.
<li>There is a risk that user-built guards may be poorly designed or 
     built.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Point-of-Operation Guards</b>
<p>
Point-of-operation safeguarding is complicated by the number and 
complexity of machines and also by the different uses for individual 
machines.  For these reasons, not all machine builders provide 
point-of-operation guards on their products.  In many cases a 
point-of-operation guard can only be made and installed by the user after 
a thorough hazard analysis of the work requirements.  Poorly designed, 
built or installed guards may create a hazard rather than eliminate one.  
To be effective they must safeguard the employee while allowing the work 
to continue with minimum disruption to the production process.
<p>
<b>Mechanical Power Transmission Apparatus Guarding</b>
<p>
A significant difference between power transmission guards and
point-of-operation guards is that the former type needs no opening for
feeding stock.  The only openings necessary for power transmission guards
are those for lubrication, adjustment, repair, and inspection.  These
openings should be provided with interlocked covers that cannot be removed
except by using tools for service or adjustment. 
<p>
To be effective, power transmission guards should cover all moving parts 
in such a manner that no part of the operator's body can come in contact 
with them.
<p>
<b>Guard Material</b>
<p>
Under many circumstances, metal is the best material for guards.  Guard 
framework is usually made from structural shapes, pipe, bar, or rod stock. 
Filler material generally is expanded or perforated or solid sheet metal 
or wire mesh.  It may be feasible to use plastic or safety glass where 
visibility is required.  
<p>
Guards made of wood generally are not recommended because of their 
flammability and lack of durability and strength.  However, in areas where 
corrosive materials are present, wooden guards may be the better choice.
