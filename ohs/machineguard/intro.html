This manual has been prepared as an aid to employers, employees, machine 
manufacturers, machine guard designers and fabricators, and all others 
with an interest in protecting workers against the hazards of moving 
machine parts.  It identifies the major mechanical motions and the general 
principles of safeguarding them.  Current applications of each technique 
are shown in accompanying illustrations of specific operations and 
machines.  The methods described here may be transferred, with due care, 
to different machines with similar hazards.  To determine whether or not 
safeguarding meets the requirements of the standard, any mechanical motion 
that threatens a worker's safety should not remain unguarded.
<p>
The approaches to machine safeguarding discussed in this manual are not 
the only solutions which meet the requirements of the standard.  Why?  
Because practical solutions to safeguarding moving machine parts are as 
numerous as the people working on them.  No publication could keep pace 
with all of these solutions or attempt to depict them all.
<p>
In machine safeguarding, as in other regulated areas of the American 
workplace, to a certain extent OSHA standards govern function and 
practice.  This text, however, is not a substitute for the standards.  It 
is a manual of basic technical information and workable ideas which the 
employer may use as a guide to achieve compliance.  It offers an overview 
of the machine safeguarding problem in the industrial setting, an 
assortment of solutions in popular use, and a challenge to all whose work 
involves machines.
<p>
Many readers of this manual already have the judgment, knowledge, and 
skill to develop effective answers to problems yet unsolved.  Innovators 
are encouraged to find here stimulation to eliminate mechanical hazards 
facing America's workers today.
