      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The University of 
        Kentucky has developed a written policy for safe entry into confined spaces. 
        The University recognizes that certain environmental conditions within 
        confined spaces are capable of causing death to anyone who enters the 
        space without taking precautionary measures. Therefore, each entry into 
        a confined space must be evaluated by the supervisor to determine the 
        hazards involved and appropriate safety measures and controls that must 
        be taken to ensure a safe environment. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Safe entry into a 
        confined space is the responsibility of both the supervisor and the employee 
        who performs the work. Supervisors must ensure that this procedure is 
        followed and that all personnel understand and comply with the safety 
        requirements. The employee must inform the supervisor of any departure 
        from this procedure. </font></p>

        <font size="3"><b>DEFINITION OF A CONFINED SPACE</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A confined space 
        is a space that is large enough and so configured that an employee can 
        bodily enter and perform assigned work. It has limited or restricted means 
        for entry or exit, and is not designed for continuous employee occupancy. 
        Additionally, the space may contain a potentially hazardous atmosphere, 
        it may have limited oxygen content, it may contain mechanical and /or 
        electrical equipment which upon contact or activation may trap, crush, 
        or electrocute persons in the space. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Some examples of 
        confined spaces at the University of Kentucky include but are not limited 
        to: sewers, septic tanks, sewage digestors, pump stations, wells, manure 
        pits and tanks, silos, vats, ducts, utility vaults, process vessels, boilers, 
        pipelines, pits, ventilation and exhaust units, storage bins, hoppers, 
        and caves. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The University of 
        Kentucky must evaluate each confined space to determine if that space 
        is to be designated as a <b>Permit-Required Confined Space</b> or a <b>Non-permit
