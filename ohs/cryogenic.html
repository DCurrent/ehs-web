        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of the inherent danger, only 
        knowledgeable personnel should handle cryogenic materials, fluid-piping 
        systems, and related equipment. A variety of physical hazards are associated 
        with this class of material: </font>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Serious burns to the skin 
            can result from direct contact with a cryogen or related equipment. 
            </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Permanent damage to the 
            eyes can result from contact with liquid cryogen. </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liquid cryogens warmed 
            above their critical temperature will generate high pressures that 
            can cause a confining vessel to rupture or even explode. Fully containing 
            a cryogenic fluid as a liquid at room temperature is usually not feasible. 
            For example, the pressure required to maintain liquid nitrogen at 
            room temperature is 43,000 psi. </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cryogens have significant 
            potential for creating oxygen deficiency because they have large liquid-to-gas 
            expansion ratios, generally greater than 700 to 1. A small spill produces 
            a large volume of gas that can displace air in a confined space, creating 
            a serious oxygen deficiency. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In addition to being a physical 
          hazard and an asphyxiant, cryogenic material may also be corrosive, 
          flammable, or reactive. Storage dewars and process vessels must be labeled 
          with the common name of the contents written in English. Material Safety 
          Data Sheets (or comparable safety information) and emergency leak or 
          spill procedures for each cryogen must be available in the immediate 
          area where these materials are stored or used. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Safe handling practices 
          must be observed whenever working with or around cryogens. Do not use 
          cryogens in unventilated spaces such as closets or transport in vehicles 
          without adequate ventilation. When transferring cryogen from pressurized 
          dewars with hoses or tubing, be sure to verify that there are pressure 
          relief devices between all valves. Cryogens can be trapped in the transfer 
          hose or in the tube between two valves, which may cause the hose to 
          rupture and whip around out of control. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Cryogenic liquids present 
          special fire and explosion hazards. A flammable mixture cooled in the 
          presence of air with liquid nitrogen or liquid oxygen can cause oxygen 
          to condense and thereby create an explosive mixture. Keep these mixtures 
          away from ignition sources. Transport fragile cryogenic containers with 
          caution-use a hand truck. Cushion glassware in a protective covering 
          to prevent injury caused by flying glass in the event of implosion/explosion.

        <p align="center"> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Personal 
          Protective Equipment</b> </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Eye, hand, and body protection 
          must be worn to prevent contact of liquid cryogens with the eyes or 
          exposed skin. A hazard evaluation performed on each cryogenic operation 
          will determine the specific personal protective equipment (PPE) required. 
          The following are the minimum PPE requirements for cryogenic operations:</font>

            <td><font size="2" face="arial">When pouring liquid nitrogen from a dewar, use non-vented chemical goggles or safety glasses with side shields.

Loose-fitting gloves can be thrown off readily if cryogen is spilled into them.  Small spills of liquid nitrogen, if not trapped against the skin, will usually evaporate without causing damage.</font></td></tr>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The most likely cause of 
          frostbite to the hands and body is contact with cold metal surfaces. 
          Frostbite can be instantaneous if the skin is moist. Immediate treatment 
          is vital. Report promptly to a medical care facility or call 911 and 
          follow these suggestions: </font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Warm the affected area 
            rapidly by immersion in water (not to exceed 105° F), body heat, or 
            exposure to warm air. </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calm the victim and avoid 
            aggravating the injury. People with frostbitten feet should not walk 
            on them. Do not rub or massage the affected parts of the body. </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the eyes are affected,
