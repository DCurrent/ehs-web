<p>It is the policy of the University of Kentucky to provide a safe and healthful workplace environment for its employees, students, and visitors.  In order to ensure this policy, the University has established a Hearing Conservation Program.  This program applies to all persons working in areas or with equipment that have noise levels of 85 decibels, A weighting (dBA) or higher.  A copy of this program will be maintained by all departments affected.

<b>Noise Monitoring</b>
<p>
Monitoring for noise exposure levels will be conducted by the Occupational Health and Safety Department.  It is the responsibility of the individual departments to notify OHS when there is a possible need for monitoring.  Monitoring will be performed with the use of sound level meters and personal dosimeters at the discretion of Occupational Health and Safety Department (OHS).
<p>
Monitoring will also be conducted whenever there is a change in equipment, process, or controls that affects the noise levels.  This includes the addition or removal of machinery, alteration in building structure, or substitution of new equipment in place of that previously used.  It is the responsibility of the department to inform OHS

<b>Hearing Protection</b>
<p>
Hearing protection will be provided at no cost to employees who perform tasks designated as having a high noise exposure and replaced as necessary.   It is the responsibility of the department to require employees wear hearing protection when noise levels reach or exceed 85 dBA.  Those employees will have the opportunity to choose from at least three different types of hearing protection.  Personal stereo headsets or "Walkmen" are not approved for hearing protection.  Signage is required in hearing protection areas.
<p>
The areas or job tasks designated as requiring hearing protection are:

<b>Employee Training</b>
<p>
 Affected employees will be required to receive training concerning the proper usage and wearing of hearing protection.  The training will be conducted by the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Department, or a designated representative, within a month of hire and annually thereafter.  Training will include information on the effects of noise on hearing, the purpose of hearing protection, an explanation of audiometric testing, and the OSHA noise standard.
<p>
Training records will be kept by the Occupational Health and Safety Department and a copy will be sent to the department affected, (sample form attached).

<b>Audiograms/Hearing Test</b>
<p>
Employees included in the hearing conservation program who have time-weighted average (TWA) noise exposures of 85 dBA or greater for an eight (8) hour work shift will be required to have both a baseline and annual audiogram.  The audiogram will be provided by the University and conducted by the Department of Preventive Medicine and Environmental Health, with no cost to the employee.  
<p>
The baseline audiogram will be given to an employee within one (1) month of employment with the University of Kentucky and before <b>any</b> exposure to high noise levels.  Annual audiograms will be performed within one year from the date of the previous audiogram.  It is the responsibility of the individual and their respective departments to schedule the annual audiogram.
<p>
If an annual audiogram shows that an employee has suffered a standard threshold shift, the employee will be retested within thirty (30) days of the original audiogram.  If the retest confirms the occurrence of a standard threshold shift, the employee will be notified in writing within twenty-one (21) days of the confirmation.  Employees who do experience a standard threshold shift will also be refitted with hearing protection and provided more training on the effects of noise.

<b>Noise Standard</b>
<p>
A copy of the noise standard is attached with this program and is to be made available to any employees affected.  A copy of the standard will also be posted in areas with affected employees.
