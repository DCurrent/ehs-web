                  <p>An AED (automated external defibrillator) is a piece of medical equipment used to treat cardiac<br>
                      arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. It automatically diagnoses the hearts rhythm to determine if a shock<br>
                      needs to be administered to a person, and will deliver that shock if needed. As technology for this<br>
                      equipment has improved and the cost to purchase them has decreased over the last several years, more<br>
                  AEDs are being used in public and private settings.</p>
                  <p>                      While studies done by the American Heart Association (AHA) show that AEDs can in fact save lives, the<br>
                      use of onsite portable AEDs may not always be the most effective care that can be provided to someone<br>
                      in cardiac arrest on our campus. The Ontario Pre-hospital Advanced Life Support Study (OPALS) is the<br>
                      gold standard in cardiac arrest studies. It found that locations that were able to provide optimal rapid<br>
                      defibrillation (emergency personnel administering shock in less than 8 minutes) were effective in the<br>
                      survival of a person suffering from cardiac arrest. Ability of EMS to respond quickly, CPR and AED<br>
                      training, and the appropriate placement of maintained AEDs are important keys in the improvement of<br>
                      survival. Many areas on the University of Kentucky’s campus have less than an 8 minute response time<br>
                      for emergency personnel and therefore an AED may not be necessary. UK Occupational Health &amp; Safety<br>
                      requires that departments submit an official <a href="http://ehs.uky.edu/apps/shocker">request form</a> for approval before procuring an AED so that a<br>
                    review of your specific need for having this regulated piece of equipment can be done.</p>

                  <p>OH&amp;S wants to ensure that AED boxes are installed in easily accessible and visible areas so that trained<br>
                      staff can locate and access them quickly. We also want to make sure that they are maintained<br>
                      appropriately and used in a safe manner. This means that each building or area that has or intends to<br>
                      procure and AED has someone assigned to manage the equipment and perform all other duties that are<br>

                    <ul>
                      <li>If you acquire an AED you must inform an agent of the local emergency medical services system<br>
and the local emergency communications or vehicle dispatch center. The location and type of<br>
AED acquired must be given to this agent (i.e. local 911/dispatch).</li>
                      <li>People that will be expected to use the AED must be properly trained in CPR and AED use.</li>
                      <li>Maintenance and testing of the AED must be done in accordance with the guidelines set by the</li>
                      <li>manufacturer of the AED equipment.</li>
                      <li>Oversight of your AED program must be by a physician who is licensed to practice in the state of<br>
                        Kentucky.</li>
                      <li>If the AED is used for emergency care or treatment for a person in cardiac arrest, the local<br>
                        emergency medical services system must be notified as soon as possible. The licensed physician<br>
                        performing oversight of your AED program must also be informed. <a href="http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/Statrev/ACTS2000/0016.pdf">Complete KY statute regarding AEDs</a>. </li>
