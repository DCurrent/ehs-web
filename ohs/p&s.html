The purpose of this program is to set forth standard operating procedures governing the selection and use of respirators.  Appropriate respirators shall be used in accordance with this program to control adverse health effects caused by breathing harmful air contaminants.  Though the primary objective shall be to prevent atmospheric contamination, respirators shall be used when effective engineering controls are not feasible, or while they are being implemented.
