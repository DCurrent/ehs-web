      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following guide 
        has been developed to assist you in your scheduled safety surveillance 
        of laboratories and departments under your auspices as safety coordinator. 
        This guide is by no means all encompassing, however information contained 
        after each item should assist you in determining whether your area may 
        be in full, partial or non-compliance.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Keep in mind that 
        all Federal, State and University rules, recommendations and regulations 
        determine the compliance of our area concerning OSHA, EPA, NIH, CDC, and 
        DOT. If you have any specific questions on the information below, please 
        turn to the end of these guidelines for the names and numbers of individuals 
        at the University who will be able to assist you. Updates will be distributed 
        to safety coordinators as they occur.</font> </p>
