        is intended to make lab workers aware of an accident that occurred while 
        using a device to produce dry ice in flake or snow form, pictured below. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">A UK researcher was injured 
        when using a carbon dioxide cylinder with a device called a Frigimat Jr. 
        (Bel-Air Products, Product No. F38886-0000) to form flaked dry ice. This 
        device includes a brass nozzle with a polypropylene cone, clamp, and cloth 
        bag. It screws directly into cylinder of liquid carbon dioxide. The bag 
        is then secured on the cone with the clamp. Manufacturer's instructions 
        call for the cylinder valve to be opened about 3/4 turn and the compressed 
        liquid carbon dioxide expands into the bag. On this occasion the researcher 
        opened the valve of they cylinder approximately 3 or 4 turns and a mixture 
        of solid and gas forms of carbon dioxide were released at high pressure 
        into the researcher's face. The cylinder valve popped and the cone of 
        the dry ice appliance was cracked. His prescriptive safety glasses were 
        knocked off his face due to the extreme impact. The researcher was taken 
        to the emergency room where he was treated for traumatic injury, corneal 
        abrasion, and cold burn. </font></p>
