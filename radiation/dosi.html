Personnel monitoring devices (film badges, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), pocket
dosimeters, etc.) are issued by the Radiation Safety Office to measure an individual's exposure to radiation. A personnel monitoring device is issued only upon the completion of a "<a href="KYReg/appc.html">Radiation Worker Registration</a>" form and viewing the radiation safety videos offered through the Radiation Safety Office.
<P>
Additional radiation safety training provided by the Radiation Safety Office will be required as
soon as possible, but no less than 4 months upon filing a "<a href="KYReg/appc.html">Radiation Worker Registration</a>" form.
<P>
Individuals working with H-3, C-14, S-35 or very small quantities of radioactive material such as
I-125 in-vitro kits do not need personal monitoring devices, unless He/she frequents a laboratory which uses P-32, a gamma emitter or x-ray emitter. The Radiation Safety Officer may require the use of pocket dosimeters, ring badges, or other monitoring devices when particular procedures are in operation.
<P>
Ring badges are issued to individuals in Nuclear Medicine and Radiation Medicine and individuals
working with greater than 1 mCi of P-32 and I-125 and x-ray units. They may also be required by the RSO for other uses of radioactive material or radiation producing devices.
<p>
<b>Monitoring Requirements</b>
<P>
Radiation protection regulations and UK policy require that appropriate personnel monitoring equipment be provided to individuals who:
         
         <BLOCKQUOTE><P>* are likely to receive an
         annual radiation dose in excess of 10 percent of any of the
         following annual dose limits:
		<ul>         
         	<li>total effective dose equivalent of 5 rems
         	<li>sum of the deep dose equivalent and the
         	committed dose equivalent to an individual organ or tissue
         	(other than the lens of the eye) being equal to 50
         	rems
		<li>eye dose equivalent of 15 rems
		<li>shallow dose equivalent of 50 rems to
         	the skin or to an extremity
		<li>intake of the applicable Annual Limits
         	of Intake listed in Section 44(9), table 1, 902 KAR
         	100.
		</ul>
	<P>
	* are under 18 years of age and are
     	likely to receive a radiation dose in excess of 1 percent of
     	the occupational exposure listed above.
	<P>* are radiation workers and have declared
	a pregnancy or planned pregnancy.
	<P>* enter a High Radiation Area (exposure
	to greater than 100 millirems in any one hour).
	<P>* operate analytical X-ray devices (ring
        and whole body badges).
	<P>* meet special criteria as assessed by
	the Radiation Safety Officer or his/her delegated
	representative.
