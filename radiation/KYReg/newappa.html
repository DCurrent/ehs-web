        <P> <font size=2 face=arial> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          &quot;<a href="application.html">Application for Authorization to Possess 
          and Use Radioactive Material</a>&quot;, RSO-1 is to be used when applying 
          for use of radioactive sealed and unsealed sources, use of material 
          in animals or humans. It must be completed in full and all pertinent 
          documentation attached to be considered for review by the Radiation 
          Safety Committee. This includes a response to each item in section 9 
          under the radioactive material use category. In addition, a curricula 
          vita (resume) and Radiation Worker Registration form is needed for the 
          Authorized User and a <a href="newappb.html">Radiation Worker Registration 
          form</a> for each of his/her research staff. </font></font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Provide 
          the information about yourself in section 1. It is important that you 
          provide a telephone number where we may reach you during the day. Section 
          2 is self-explanatory. In section 3, name the room(s) and building(s) 
          where you will be using and storing radioactive material. List all radionuclides 
          to be used and the pertinent information in section 4. Total quantities 
          means total amounts you may have on hand at any one time. The maximum 
          quantities per experiment are the largest amount you would use when 
          conducting an experiment. If the radioactive material is in a hazardous 
          form, document that in section 5. In section 6 check off all safety 
          precautions to be used in your research. See the radiation safety website 
          for suggested safety precautions. Describe waste disposal procedures 
          in section 7. In section 8 describe the methods and procedures for ensuring 
          that radioactive material will be secured from unauthorized access.

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please 
          note that you must complete the appropriate category in section 9 for 
          each radionuclide. For example, if you are working with tritium and 
          P-32 in an unsealed form, you will respond to items 1 through 7 in category 
          B for both tritium and P-32. However, in some cases the response may 
          be the same. If you have any questions regarding the application, feel 
          free to contact the Radiation Safety Office. We will be glad to answer 
          questions and set up a meeting with you to go over the application prior 
          to submittal for approval.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Upon completing 
          the form with attachments send two (2) copies of the document to the 
          Radiation Safety Office, 102 Animal Pathology Building, Speed Sort 0076. 
          Applications will be processed within four weeks and the applicant notified 
          of the results.* If the authorization is for a new user, the Authorized 
          User will be contacted by the Radiation Safety Office to schedule an 
          initial inspection of the laboratory prior to use of material.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> *Note: 
          More time may be required to process the application if information 
          is missing.</font></p>
