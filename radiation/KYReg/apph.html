</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>the derived limit for the amount of radioactive material taken into the body of an adult worker by inhalation or ingestion in a year. ALI is the smaller value of intake of a given radionuclide in a year by the reference man that would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of five (5) rems (0.05 Sv) or a committed dose equivalent of fifty (50) rems (five-tenths (0.5) Sv) to an individual organ or tissue. (ALI values for intake by ingestion and by inhalation of selected radionuclides are given in 902 KAR 100:019, Section 44, Table 1, Columns 1 and 2.)</TD>
