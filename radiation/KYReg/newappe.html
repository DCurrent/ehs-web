          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Biohazards 
            - As a general rule, if you generate waste that is both radioactive 
            and biohazardous, you should contact both the Biosafety Officer and 
            the Radiation Safety Officer for proper handling procedures. Prior 
            to pickup by the Radiation Safety Office, any solid waste contaminated 
            with potentially infectious material must be sterilized. Do not place 
            radioactive biohazard material in &quot;red bags&quot; unless the 
            radioactivity is in exempt quantities. Red bags are only to be used 
            for materials that are to be incinerated. Sharps (needles and syringes, 
            scalpels, etc.) must be placed in special sharps containers and properly 
            labeled; contact the Radiation Safety Office for handling. &quot;Clinical 
            waste&quot; that contains only H-3, C-14, or I-125 in concentrations 
            &lt;0.05 uCi/gram is not regulated as radioactive waste and may be 
            disposed of as medical waste. </font></li>

          can provide 5 gallon plastic carboys for aqueous waste. Liquid wastes

                User per day. These disposals must be made only at designated,

                all these disposals (in uCi) and the information must be provided

                of this permission is to dispose of small quantities of radioactivity 
                contained in large volumes of fluid (&gt;1 liter). Examples of 
                such solutions are rinse water and buffer solutions. Radioactive 
                liquids discharged to the sanitary sewer should be flushed with 
                large amounts of running water. Liquid waste contaminated with 
                plutonium or hazardous chemical constituents may not be poured

          is strongly discouraged. Use of shared containers requires pre-approval. 
          The Radiation Safety Office can approve shared use upon application 
          and review. Mixed waste (e.g., scintillation vials) will also require 
          approval by Environmental Management. Approval will require one 
          Authorized User to take responsibility for the container and its contents 
          and may be terminated if the specific requirements below are not met.
