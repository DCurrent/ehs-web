      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lasers are classified to describe 
        the capabilities of a laser system to produce injury to personnel. This 
        classification rates from Class I lasers (no harm) to Class IV lasers 
        like the 2000 Watt, carbon dioxide (let's cut thick steel) laser here 
        on campus. The manufacturer is required to label Class II, III and IV 
        lasers with a warning label which will also have the laser's classification 
        printed on it. </font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Class I lasers</b> 
        are low powered devices that are considered safe from all potential hazards. 
        Some examples of Class I laser use are: laser printers, CD players, CD 
        ROM devices, geological survey equipment and laboratory analytical equipment. 
        No individual, regardless of exposure conditions to the eyes or skin, 
        would be expected to be injured by a Class I laser. <i>No</i> safety requirements 
        are needed to use Class I laser devices. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Class II lasers</b> 
        are low power (&lt; 1mW), visible light lasers that could possibly cause 
        damage to a person's eyes. Some examples of Class II laser use are: classroom 
        demonstrations, laser pointers, aiming devices and range finding equipment. 
        If class II laser beams are directly viewed for long periods of time (i.e. 
        > 15 minutes) damage to the eyes could result. Avoid looking into a Class 
        II laser beam or pointing a Class II laser beam into another person's 
        eyes. Avoid viewing Class II laser beams with telescopic devices. Realize 
        that the bright light of a Class II laser beam into your eyes will cause 
        a normal reaction to look away or close your eyes. This response is expected 
        to protect you from Class II laser damage to the eyes. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Class IIIa lasers</b> 
        are continuous wave, intermediate power (1-5 mW) devices. Some examples 
        of Class IIIa laser uses are the same as Class II lasers with the most 
        popular uses being laser pointers and laser scanners. Direct viewing of 
        the Class IIIa laser beam could be hazardous to the eyes. <i>Do not</i> 
        view the Class IIIa laser beam directly. <i>Do not</i> point a Class IIIa 
        laser beam into another persons eyes. <i>Do not</i> view a Class IIIa 
        laser beam with telescopic devices; this amplifies the problem. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Class IIIb lasers</b> 
        are intermediate power (c.w. 5-500 mW or pulsed 10 J/cm²) devices. Some 
        examples of Class IIIb laser uses are spectrometry, stereolithography, 
        and entertainment light shows. Direct viewing of the Class IIIb laser 
        beam is hazardous to the eye and diffuse reflections of the beam can also 
        be hazardous to the eye. <i>Do not</i> view the Class IIIb laser beam 
        directly. <i>Do not</i> view a Class IIIb laser beam with telescopic devices; 
        this amplifies the problem. Whenever occupying a laser controlled area, 
        wear the proper eye protection. Refer to the University of Kentucky Laser 
        Safety Manual for complete instructions on the safety requirements for 
        Class IIIb laser use. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Class IV lasers</b> 
        are high power (c.w. >500mW or pulsed >10J/cm²) devices. Some examples 
        of Class IV laser use are surgery, research, drilling, cutting, welding, 
        and micromachining. The direct beam and diffuse reflections from Class 
        IV lasers are hazardous to the eyes and skin. Class IV laser devices can 
        also be a fire hazard depending on the reaction of the target when struck. 
        Much greater controls are required to ensure the safe operation of this 
        class of laser devices. Whenever occupying a laser controlled area, wear 
        the proper eye protection. Most laser eye injuries occur from reflected 
        beams of class IV laser light, so keep all reflective materials away from 
        the beam. Do not place your hand or any other body part into the class 
        IV laser beam. The pain and smell of burned flesh will let you know if 
        this happens. Realize the dangers involved in the use of Class IV lasers 
        and please use common sense. Refer to the University of Kentucky Laser 
        Safety Manual for complete instructions on the safety requirements for 
        Class IV laser use.</font> </p>
