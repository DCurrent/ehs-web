  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  The "<a href="appauth.html">Application
  for Authorization to Possess and Use Radioactive Material</a>", RSO-1 is to
  be used when applying for use of radioactive sealed and unsealed sources, use
  of material in animals or humans and use in gas chromatographs. It must be
  completed in full and all pertinent documentation attached to be considered
  for review by the Radiation Safety Committee. This includes a response to each
  item in section 9 under the radioactive material use category. In addition
  a curricula vita (resume) and Radiation Worker Registration form is needed
  for the Authorized User and a Radiation Worker Registration form for each of
  his/her research staff. Make sure you provide a sketch of the facility for
  the categories: sealed and unsealed sources.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Provide this Office with information about yourself in section 1. It is important that you provide a telephone number that we may reach you at during the day. Section 2 is self-explanatory. In section 3 you must provide this Office with the room and building in which you will be using and storing radioactive material. List all radioisotopes to be used and the pertinent information in section 4. Total quantities means total amounts you will have on hand at any one time. The maximum quantities per experiment is the largest amount you would use when conducting an experiment. If the radioactive material is in a hazardous form document that in section 5. In section 6 check off all safety precautions to be used in your research. See the radiation safety website for suggested safety precautions. Describe waste disposal procedures in section 7. In section 8 describe the methods and procedures for ensuring that radioactive material will be secured from unauthorized access. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to note that you must complete the appropriate category in section 9 for each radioactive isotope. For example, if you are working with tritium and P-32 in an unsealed form, you will respond to items 1 through 7 in category B for both tritium and P-32. However, in some cases the response may be the same and you only need one facility sketch, with locations of both radioisotopes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have any questions regarding the application, feel free to contact the Radiation Safety Office. We will be glad to answer questions and set up a meeting with you to go over the application prior to submittal for approval.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon completing the form with attachments send five (5) copies of the document to the Radiation Safety Office, 102 Animal Pathology Building, Speed Sort 0076.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Applications will be processed within four weeks and the applicant notified of the results.* If the authorization is for a new user, the Authorized User will be contacted by the Radiation Safety Office to schedule an initial inspection of the laboratory prior to use of material.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*Note: More time may be required to process the application if information is missing.</font></p></td></tr><tr>
