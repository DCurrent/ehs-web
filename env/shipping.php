			<h1>Shipping Dangerous Goods</h1>
      <p><img width="151" height="151" src="media/shipping_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRDOH-qXPacDm0zPo26sDowTdQd6mGxiu18K2_8IbiyxMUG9bcpwQ" />The US Department of Transportation (DOT) has  established&nbsp;<a href="//www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_03/49cfrv2_03.html" target="_blank">regulations</a>&nbsp;for domestic  transport (within the United States) of hazardous materials by rail, air,  vessel (ships), and motor carrier (ground).&nbsp;  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has established  guidelines exclusively for the transport of dangerous goods by air (both  domestic and international). The DOT term &ldquo;Hazardous Material&rdquo; and IATA term  &ldquo;Dangerous Good&rdquo; are used interchangeably by the University.</p>
			<p> When  shipping via air (international or domestic), you must use the IATA  guidelines.&nbsp; Each carrier may have  special provisions that must be met before a package containing dangerous goods  can be transported on an aircraft. In addition, when shipping internationally,  some countries have specific requirements for dangerous goods. All of these are  addressed in the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations.<br />
			  </p>
			<p>Shipments  with dangerous goods must be tendered in accordance with current IATA  regulations for air transport. This is required regardless of the routing and  whether the shipment ends up physically moving by air transportation, ground  transportation, or a combination of these. Dangerous goods includes aerosol  sprays, airbags, butane, car batteries, dry ice, fireworks, gasoline, jet fuel,  lighters, lithium batteries, matches, nitrogen-refrigerated liquid, paint,  chemicals such as solvents, oxidizers, reactives and corrosives and poisons,  and more.&nbsp; Furthermore, infectious  substances affecting humans and infectious substances affecting animals are  considered dangerous goods<br />
			  If you are  unsure whether your commodity meets the criteria for dangerous goods or which  dangerous goods identification and classification applies to your shipment,  contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mblac0@uky.edu">Mike Blackard</a> (257-7375).</p>
		  <p> Any faculty,  staff, or student associated with the University who is involved in shipping  hazardous goods is subject to these rules. While many of our laboratories are  likely to be impacted, other units may be impacted and must be sensitive to  common items that may meet the hazardous materials definition. For example,  paint may be covered as a flammable liquid and aerosol spray cans as a  compressed gas. </p>
            <h2>Initial Training<br />
              <br />
              </h2>

              <p>The University requires all faculty, staff  and student who are involved in any aspect of shipping hazardous materials  (e.g., packing, labeling, transporting, etc.) to attend an <a href="/classes/classes_env_0001.php#dot_iata">Initial DOT/IATA Training  Course</a>. This is a live on-campus training course  conducted without charge by the Environmental Management Department (EMD) on a  regular basis.&nbsp; Contact <a href="mailto:pquisenb@uky.edu">Peggy Quisenberry</a> (323-6280) to register for the course. </p>
          <h2>Refresher Certification*</h2>
        <p><img width="280" height="97" src="shipping_clip_image008.jpg" align="center" hspace="12" alt="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRLWKPKBuvhOMxIpZsEfg2enfsMjv7gIDPKuA6IriZhvTXz8T1j" /></p>
            <p>At least  every two years following the completion of the Initial Training course, it is  required to complete on-line <a href="/classes/classes_env_0001.php#dot_iata">DOT/IATA  Recertification</a> to maintain the legal  ability to ship dangerous goods.**</p>
<p>*&nbsp;This refresher  certification can only be taken by individuals who have previously successfully completed  the Initial Dangerous Goods Shipping classroom version of the DOT/IATA training.</p>
<p>** If recertification is not completed within  two years of the Initial Training date, the classroom training must be retaken. </p>
