        <h2 id="initial_radiation_safety">On-Site and Initial Radiation Safety for New Radiation Workers</h2>
        <p>All  individuals at UK  proposing to work with radioactive material or x-ray must, as per federal and  state regulations, receive On-Site &amp; Initial Radiation Safety Training  before starting as a radiation worker. Daily initial training sessions are available through the Radiation  Safety Office, 102 Animal   Pathology Building.</p>
        
        <p>All  workers must complete the <a href="../docs/pdf/rad_worker_reg_form_0001.pdf" target="_blank">Radiation Worker Registration Form</a> before training.</p>
        
        <p>The  first training is On-Site Training which must be provided by the Authorized  User or unit supervisor at the individual&rsquo;s place of work.&nbsp; A completed<a href="../docs/pdf/rad_research_onsite_training_form_0001.pdf" target="_blank"> Research On-Site Training Form</a> is provided to the individual as evidence of receiving this part of  the training. </p>
        
        <p>The  second part is the Initial Training. &nbsp;Initial Training is held Monday &ndash; Friday at  1:30pm at the Radiation Safety Office, 102 Animal Pathology Bldg. Please arrive  by 1:20pm so the receptionist can process your paperwork.&nbsp; If you cannot make this scheduled time, call  the Radiation Safety Office at 3-6777 to schedule a specific appointment.&nbsp; This training is a video and/or lecture  lasting about fifteen minutes.&nbsp; You will  receive the training form when you come to the training.</p>
        
        <p>The  individual must bring a copy of the signed <a href="../docs/pdf/rad_research_onsite_training_form_0001.pdf" target="_blank">Research On-Site Training Form</a> and a completed, signed <a href="../docs/pdf/rad_worker_reg_form_0001.pdf" target="_blank">Radiation Worker Registration Form</a> to the  Initial Training.&nbsp; If working in a lab,  the Worker Registration form must be signed the AU/PI who holds the license to  the lab.&nbsp; No one will be admitted without  both of these forms.</p>
        
        <p>The  On-Site and Initial training enables an individual to begin as a radiation  worker.&nbsp; Research workers are required to  attend the Basic Radiation Safety course. The Basic course is a three-hour lecture and  demonstration style course that covers radioactive material radiation  characteristics and safety in detail. Specific x-ray safety (diagnostic, veterinary, dental, research) courses  will be scheduled as needed.&nbsp; A  certificate will be awarded upon completion of Basic Radiation Safety.</p>
        
        <p>Contact (859) 323-6276 for more information.</p>
