                  <h2 id="aerial_lift_safety">Aerial Lift Safety</h2>
                  
					<p>Aerial lifts are commonly used in construction, inspection, athletic events and repair services to lift University employees to an elevated work position. Proper operation and use of aerial lifts can make completion of tasks at elevation, safer and more efficient. However, unsafe use, operation and aerial lift work practices can result in serious injury. This program has been developed due to the hazards associated with improper use and the university&rsquo;s concern for the safety of individuals in and around this type of equipment. In addition, this program outlines general, operating, maintenance, inspection and training requirements governing safe aerial lift use at the University.</p>
					
                  <p>A hands on practicum will be scheduled for those who attend this classroom training to be completed to be certified.</p>
                  
					<p>Classroom training sessions are available upon request. Duration is 1 hour. Contact <a href="mailto:Michele.Laur@uky.edu" data-mce-href="mailto:Michele.Laur@uky.edu">Michele Laur</a> at <a href="tel:+18592573862" title="Call (859) 257-9739.">(859) 257-9739</a>.</p>

                  <p>As  part of routine operational, research, and farming activities, UK College of  Agriculture, Food and Environment (CAFE) employees and students may utilize  All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV) for conducting various tasks. ATV use may be  dangerous to operator health and safety due to the many unique hazards  associated with operating them. ATVs are designed for off-road use, which  includes, but is not limited to, driving on uneven surfaces, hills, rocks, and  depressions. Driving surfaces can also be dusty, wet, soft, or slippery. In  order to prevent accidents and injuries, employees and students must be trained  in the safe operation of ATVs and the driving hazards unique to each location.</p>
