                  <p>As  part of routine operational, research, and farming activities, UK College of  Agriculture, Food and Environment (CAFE) employees and students may utilize  All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV) for conducting various tasks. ATV use may be  dangerous to operator health and safety due to the many unique hazards  associated with operating them. ATVs are designed for off-road use, which  includes, but is not limited to, driving on uneven surfaces, hills, rocks, and  depressions. Driving surfaces can also be dusty, wet, soft, or slippery. In  order to prevent accidents and injuries, employees and students must be trained  in the safe operation of ATVs and the driving hazards unique to each location.</p>
