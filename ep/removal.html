        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From time to time, 
          UK has need to conduct asbestos abatement (removal) projects. The asbestos 
          work is usually connected with construction, renovation, or demolition 
          projects. Asbestos removal is also performed when damaged or deteriorated 
          asbestos-containing building materials are discovered, in order to reduce 
          the potential health hazards to UK employees, students, and visitors. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In most cases, asbestos 
          work is performed by a contractor under contract with UK. The asbestos 
          removal company and its personnel are certified by the state and are 
          qualified to perform this work safely. This work should in no way endanger 
          anyone living or working in the affected building or walking outside 
          the building while the work is being completed. Air monitoring is performed 
          on every project by an independent testing lab to ensure that asbestos 
          contamination does not leave the work area and that the work was performed 
          adequately. In fact, you may hear or see the air testing pumps running 
          outside the asbestos abatement area.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because the workers
            will be disturbing asbestos-containing materials, they will be wearing
            respirators and protective clothing. Barriers and warning signs will
            be erected to isolate the work area from the rest of the building.
            Special
          waste dumpsters may be present for them to collect the removed building
            materials. The precautions and work practices used will be in accordance
            with applicable federal and state regulations and are designed to
            prevent
          anyone outside the work area from being exposed to asbestos. These
            requirements are different for each project, depending upon the type
            of material
          being removed and the methods being employed to remove them. If you
            have any questions regarding any asbestos project and the precautions
          being taken, please call Environmental Management at 257-3285.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An asbestos warning 
          sign will be posted at entrances to the work area. If you see this sign, 
          do not enter the area for any reason. Only trained, authorized personnel 
          may enter. The sign looks like this:</font></p>
