      <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is the University 
      of Kentucky's policy that all Residence Halls must be evacuated upon activation 
      of a fire alarm system. If someone has a physical or medical condition that 
      would not allow them to evacuate without some form a assistance in evacuating, 
      the policy permits that person to be evacuated to the nearest stairway for 
      the Fire Department to evacuate when necessary. </font> <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
        has been brought to our attention that in some cases a student in their 
        room would need to be placed in a wheelchair to evacuate. In these situations 
        it would require the Housing Staff or another student to put their personal 
        safety in jeopardy and risk harming the bedfast student to assist them 
        to their chair for evacuation. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an effort to resolve 
        this issue the following changes have been made:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An ADA student 
          is to be issued an &quot;Emergency Assistance Card&quot;. This card 
          will identify the student and their location in the residence hall. 
          This card should be given to another resident on their way out of the 
          building by the card's owner. The resident upon evacuation should give 
          the card and the location of the ADA student to the nearest fireman. 
          These cards can be used in any building on campus, but the student needing 
          help should always give their current location to the person who receives 
          the card.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Since not all 
          students are capable of giving their card to another individual during 
          evacuation because of their differing abilities, a list of all residents 
          requiring assistance will be kept in the Fire Alarm Control Panel in 
          each residence hall. This list will be located by the first arriving 
          fire company. The fire department will make the determination as to 
          how quickly the students needing additional support during evacuation 
          will need to be evacuated. If a resident is not in danger the Fire Department 
          will leave them in a safe location. Evacuation will be a last resort.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An Emergency Assistance 
          Card can be issued to residents with temporary conditions that would 
          keep them from evacuating upon activation of the fire alarm. Jake Karnes 
          will determine which of these students has a condition that warrants 
          a card.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the student has 
        the ability to make their way to the stairwell, the student should evacuate 
        to this location. The stairways are all fire rated and the students will 
        be visible to the incoming firemen, which makes their evacuation easier 
        and faster.</font></p>
