<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beginning in July 2000, this is the
inspection policy for the Greek Chapters. Also attached is a list of what are
considered "<a href="majordef.html">Major
Deficiencies</a>" that will be evaluated to determine if the house or an individual
room should be closed. This list is not all-inclusive. If a particular incident
is evaluated and judged to be a detriment to fire/life safety, that individual
incident will be cause to close the house or an individual room. </font>

for the Fall Semester:</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A
