<p>
Fire safety in fraternity and sorority houses is a responsibility shared among active chapters, individual house corporations, and the University of Kentucky.  The primary responsibility for an individual house's safety program belongs to the chapter president and other officers, with strong administrative support from the house corporation officers.  The University Fire Marshal, in conjunction with the Director of Procurement and Construction and the Dean of Students Office, will assist fraternities and sororities in implementing their programs through inspections, training and implementation of regulations and policies.  These programs are based on the Kentucky Building Code (KBC) and the Kentucky Fire Prevention Code (FPC).
<p>
To enhance the fire safety program, the attached regulations and policies have been developed.  The regulations and policies are mandatory and <u>must</u> be implemented in each fraternity and sorority house.  Any questions should be directed to the University Fire Marshal (257-6326).
