      <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Kentucky Fire Prevention 
      Code and UK policy require evacuation of campus buildings for fire alarms. 
      When the fire alarm system is activated, all persons must immediately evacuate 
      the building. Occupants must not return to the building until fire officials 
      give approval. Although evacuations are disruptive, life safety shall be 
      given priority. The only exception to this policy is patient-related areas, 
      such as the University Hospital and the Kentucky Clinic, where special evacuation 
      procedures have been developed and tested. Employees refusing to evacuate 
      or prohibiting others from evacuating will be subject to disciplinary action 
      in accordance with Human Resources Policy and Procedure Number 12.0. Students 
      refusing to evacuate or prohibiting others from evacuating will be subject 
      to disciplinary action in accordance with the Code of Student Conduct.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each 
        department should develop internal procedures pertinent to their particular 
        activities, especially research and chemical laboratories. Procedures 
        should include having a designated meeting place outside the building, 
        providing security precautions, and assisting physically impaired persons. 
        Occupants must not return to the building until the fire officials give 
        approval. Should your department need assistance in developing internal 
        procedures, please contact the University Fire Marshal&#8217;s office 
        at 257-6326. </font></p>
