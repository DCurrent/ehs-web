Fire extinguishers are not designed or intended to extinguish a large fire, but if used properly, can control a fire condition or extinguish a small fire.  When a fire condition is discovered, the first reaction should always be to activate the fire alarm system and evacuate the building according to the posted evacuation plan.  However, fire extinguishers are provided in all residence halls and can be used provided the person is properly trained to use the extinguisher.  The following are guidelines in making the decision as whether to use the unit, and how to use the extinguisher.
<p>
<b>TYPE OF EXTINGUISHER</B>:  An "ABC--ALL PURPOSE" extinguisher is provided.  This unit can be used on any type of fire that may occur.
<p>
<b>SHOULD I USE THE EXTINGUISHER</B>:  If you ask yourself this, it's too late.  Don't use the unit.
<p><center><b>HOW TO USE AN EXTINGUISHER:</B><BR>
Remember the <b>"PASS"</b> word.<p>
