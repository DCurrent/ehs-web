Fire safety is of primary concern and to have a good overall Safety Program, a strong effort is needed from all parties involved.  It is essential that each resident receives training in fire prevention and knows the proper emergency procedures should a fire occur.  To accomplish this, each Chapter house is required to conduct a training class early in the fall semester.  The following items need to receive special attention.  Upon request, the University Fire Marshal will assist in the required training.  Call 257-6326 for information.
