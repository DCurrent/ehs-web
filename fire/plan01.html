        Buildings and Construction (OHBC), which has review and inspection authority 
        for compliance with the Kentucky Building Code (KBC), has granted the 
        University of Kentucky (UK) plan review and inspection authority for construction 
        and renovation projects in certain UK facilities (January, 2006). OHBC 
        will have jurisdiction for all capital construction projects involving 
        more than $1,000,000 and all Hospital/Medical Center (Building 0293) projects. 
        UK will have jurisdiction for all other projects. OHBC may delegate selected 
        Hospital/Medical Center (Building 0293) projects to UK. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is the intent of UK to fully 
        comply with the KBC in all of its construction and renovation projects. 
        For projects delegated to UK, the University Fire Marshal&#8217;s office 
        will be responsible for enforcing the KBC and will utilize a process similar 
        to OHBC for conducting review, approval and inspections and for issuing 
        Certificates of Occupancy. </font></p>
